# StickerMaker

This project demonstrates an image processing script for your browser, designed to create stickers from images. The script utilizes TensorFlow.js to implement advanced image manipulation techniques, allowing users to transform ordinary images into fun and creative stickers.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine. Download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Project Initialization
1. Create a new directory for the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir stickermaker
   cd stickermaker
   ```
2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

### Dependencies
Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
```

## Implementation

Below is a basic implementation in `index.js` for this project, which will be expanded to include specific sticker-making functionalities:

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

// Function to load an image (to be implemented)
function loadImage(imagePath) {
  // Implementation goes here
}

// Function to process the image into a sticker (to be implemented)
function createSticker(imageTensor) {
  // Implementation goes here
}

// Function to save the sticker (to be implemented)
function saveSticker(stickerTensor, outputPath) {
  // Implementation goes here
}

// Main function to orchestrate the sticker creation process
async function makeSticker(imagePath, outputPath) {
  try {
    const imageTensor = await loadImage(imagePath);
    const stickerTensor = createSticker(imageTensor);
    await saveSticker(stickerTensor, outputPath);
    console.log('Sticker created and saved successfully!');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  }
}

// Run the main function
makeSticker('inputImage.png', 'outputSticker.png');
```

## Usage
To run the script, execute:
```bash
node index.js
```

Ensure `inputImage.png` is in the same directory as `index.js`. The script will output a new image named `outputSticker.png` which is your transformed sticker.

## Notes
- This project is designed to work in a browser environment, allowing users to directly manipulate images in their web browsers.
- The functions `loadImage`, `createSticker`, and `saveSticker` are placeholders and need to be implemented with the specific logic for image processing and sticker creation.
- TensorFlow.js provides powerful tools for image manipulation, which can be leveraged to add effects like filters, borders, or even machine learning-based transformations to create unique stickers.

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the StickerMaker project, an image processing script for your browser that turns images into stickers using TensorFlow.js.
