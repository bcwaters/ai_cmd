### Friendly Tone:
**When discussing the bounced check and unauthorized resident:**

"Hi [Tenant's Name], I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk about a couple of issues that have come up with your tenancy. It looks like the last rent check didn't go through, and I noticed there's someone living with you who isn't on the lease. I know these things can happen, and I'm here to help sort it out. Can we find a way to resolve this together?"

**When serving the eviction notice:**

"Hello [Tenant's Name], I'm sorry it's come to this, but I need to serve you with an eviction notice due to the issues we've discussed - the bounced check and the unauthorized resident. You have five days to fix these or move out. I'm here to help if you need it. Let's try to resolve this amicably."

**When communicating the final steps:**

"[Tenant's Name], since the issues haven't been resolved, I have to proceed with the eviction lawsuit. Once the court rules, you'll need to leave the property. I wish it hadn't come to this, and I'm still here if you need any assistance or have questions."

### Angry Tone:
**When discussing the bounced check and unauthorized resident:**

"[Tenant's Name], what's going on? Your rent check bounced, and now there's some unauthorized person living in my property! This is unacceptable. You need to fix this immediately or there will be serious consequences!"

**When serving the eviction notice:**

"[Tenant's Name], I'm serving you with an eviction notice right now. You've got five days to sort out the bounced check and get rid of that unauthorized resident, or you're out! Don't test me on this."

**When communicating the final steps:**

"[Tenant's Name], you didn't do what you were supposed to, so I'm taking you to court for eviction. Once the judge agrees, you're out of there. Don't think you can drag this out any longer!"

### Neutral Tone:
**When discussing the bounced check and unauthorized resident:**

"[Tenant's Name], I need to address a couple of issues. Your rent check was returned unpaid, and there's an unauthorized resident living in the property. Please let me know how you intend to resolve these matters."

**When serving the eviction notice:**

"[Tenant's Name], I am serving you with an eviction notice due to the bounced check and the unauthorized resident. You have five days to remedy these issues or vacate the premises. Please comply with the notice to avoid further legal action."

**When communicating the final steps:**

"[Tenant's Name], as you have not complied with the eviction notice, I am proceeding with the eviction lawsuit. Once the court rules in my favor, you will be required to vacate the premises."
