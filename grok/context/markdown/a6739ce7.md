Given that you are within your legal rights, have already communicated with the tenant, and have all the necessary documentation ready, here is a tailored approach for serving the eviction notice:

1. **Confirm Legal Standing**: Double-check that you are adhering to all legal requirements for eviction in your jurisdiction. Ensure you understand the specific timeline and procedures.

2. **Final Communication**: Since you've already communicated with the tenant, send a final notice via certified mail or hand-deliver it in person, ensuring you have proof of delivery. In this notice, restate the issues (bounced check and unauthorized resident) and clearly state that these breaches of the lease agreement necessitate eviction.

3. **Serve the Eviction Notice**: Include the eviction notice with the final communication. Make sure the notice adheres to the legal format required in your area. The notice should specify the date by which the tenant must vacate the property, typically 30 days, but this can vary.

4. **Documentation and Record Keeping**: Keep detailed records of all communications, including the final notice and proof of delivery. Document any further interactions with the tenant.

5. **Prepare for Possible Legal Action**: Be ready to file for eviction in court if the tenant does not comply with the notice. Consult with your legal or professional support to ensure you follow the correct procedures.

6. **Maintain Professionalism**: Throughout the process, remain calm and professional in all interactions. Avoid confrontations and focus on the legal aspects of the eviction.

By following these steps, you can proceed with the eviction process in a manner that is firm, legally compliant, and non-confrontational.
