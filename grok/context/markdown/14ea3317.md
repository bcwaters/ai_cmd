# Declaring Simple Wrapper at the Top of Each Class

Yes, you can declare the simple wrapper for `console.log` at the top of each class in JavaScript. However, doing so would mean that each class would have its own modified version of `console.log`, which might not be what you want if you're aiming for a global modification. Here's how you might do it:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // Store the original console.log function
    const originalLog = console.log;

    // Override console.log with a custom function
    console.log = function(...args) {
      // Your middleware logic here
      const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
      args.unshift(`[${timestamp}]`); // Prepend a timestamp

      // Call the original console.log with modified arguments
      originalLog.apply(console, args);
    };
  }

  someMethod() {
    console.log('Logging from MyClass');
  }
}

// Usage
const myInstance = new MyClass();
myInstance.someMethod();
```

## Considerations

- **Scope**: By declaring the wrapper inside a class, the modification will only apply within the scope of that class instance. If you create multiple instances of the class, each instance will have its own modified `console.log`.
- **Global Impact**: If you want the modification to apply globally, it's better to declare the wrapper outside of any class, at the top level of your script or module.
- **Reusability**: If you need this functionality across multiple classes, consider defining the wrapper in a separate utility file and importing it where needed.

By understanding these considerations, you can decide whether declaring the simple wrapper at the top of each class fits your use case.
