To store the output of a JavaScript file as a string value that can be referenced in a Bash script, you can modify the JavaScript to output to `stdout` and then capture this output in Bash. Here's how you can do it:

### JavaScript File

In your JavaScript file, use `console.log` to output the string you want to capture:

```javascript
// output.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Bash Script

In your Bash script, you can run the JavaScript file and capture its output into a variable using command substitution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run the JavaScript file and capture its output
output=$(node output.js)

# Now you can use the 'output' variable in your Bash script
echo "The captured output is: $output"
```

When you run this Bash script, it will execute the JavaScript file, capture the string `"Hello, World!"` into the `output` variable, and then you can use this variable as needed in your Bash script.

### Using Deno

If you're using Deno instead of Node.js, the process is similar:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run the JavaScript file with Deno and capture its output
output=$(deno run output.js)

# Now you can use the 'output' variable in your Bash script
echo "The captured output is: $output"
```

This approach allows you to store the output of your JavaScript file as a string value that can be referenced and used within your Bash script.
