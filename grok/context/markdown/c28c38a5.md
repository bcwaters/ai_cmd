# Setting Up TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up TensorFlow.js:

## Step 1: Install Node.js

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Step 2: Create a New Project

Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir tensorflow-js-project
cd tensorflow-js-project
```

Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Step 3: Install TensorFlow.js

Install TensorFlow.js using npm:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
```

## Step 4: Create a Simple Script

Create a file named `index.js` in your project directory and add the following code to test TensorFlow.js:

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

// Define a simple tensor
const tensor = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]);

// Print the tensor
tensor.print();
```

## Step 5: Run the Script

Run your script using Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the output of the tensor printed in your terminal.

That's it! You've successfully set up TensorFlow.js. Now you can start exploring more advanced features and building your own machine learning models.
