# Samson from the Bible

Samson is a figure from the Hebrew Bible, known for his incredible strength, which was linked to his uncut hair. He was a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth, and his strength was derived from his vow not to cut his hair. The story of Samson is found in the Book of Judges, chapters 13-16. His life is marked by feats of strength, such as slaying a lion with his bare hands and bringing down a Philistine temple, but also by personal failings, including his betrayal by Delilah, who cut his hair, leading to his capture and eventual death.

## The Significance of Keeping One's Hair

In Samson's story, keeping his hair uncut was a symbol of his dedication to God and the source of his strength. This reflects a broader biblical theme where physical symbols often represent spiritual commitments. For Samson, his hair was a covenant sign; cutting it broke the covenant, resulting in the loss of his strength.
