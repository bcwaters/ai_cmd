# Custom Logger Helper Class

Yes, creating a helper class for a custom logger is an excellent approach. Below is an example of how you can structure such a helper class in JavaScript to manage your logging needs effectively:

```javascript
class CustomLogger {
  constructor() {
    // Store the original console.log function
    this.originalLog = console.log;

    // Override console.log with a custom function
    console.log = (...args) => {
      // Your middleware logic here
      const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
      args.unshift(`[${timestamp}]`); // Prepend a timestamp

      // Call the original console.log with modified arguments
      this.originalLog.apply(console, args);
    };
  }

  // Method to log with additional information
  logWithInfo(message, additionalInfo) {
    console.log(message, { info: additionalInfo });
  }

  // Method to restore the original console.log
  restoreOriginalLog() {
    console.log = this.originalLog;
  }
}

// Usage
const logger = new CustomLogger();
logger.logWithInfo('This is a custom log message', { user: 'John Doe', action: 'login' });

// If needed, restore the original console.log
// logger.restoreOriginalLog();
```

## Considerations for a Custom Logger Helper Class

- **Flexibility**: This helper class allows you to easily add or modify logging behavior across your application by extending the class or adding new methods.
- **Reusability**: You can instantiate the `CustomLogger` once and use it across your application, ensuring consistent logging behavior.
- **Control**: The ability to restore the original `console.log` gives you control over when and where the custom logging is applied.
- **Additional Features**: You can add more logging methods like `logWithInfo` to cater to different logging needs, such as logging with additional context or metadata.

By using a helper class for your custom logger, you can manage and enhance your logging capabilities in a modular and maintainable way.
