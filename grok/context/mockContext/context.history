In this stillness the heart breathes and invokes, endlessly and without ceasing, only Jesus Christ who is the Son of God and Himself God. It confesses Him who alone has power to forgive our sins, and with His aid it courageously faces its enemies.\" -St. Hesychios the Priest -Read and Discuss: \"It is quite impossible to acquire any virtue by any means other than attention. It is attention that you should mostly take care of…\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian What should get my attention? -Memorize and Discuss: Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy-meditate on these things. -Philippians 4:8 -Memorize and Discuss: Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. -Colossians 3:2 -Read and Discuss: \"When we have to some extent cut off the causes of the passions, we should devote our time to spiritual contemplation: for if we fail to do this we shall easily revert to the fleshly passions, and so achieve nothing but the complete darkening of our intellect and its reversion to material things.\" -St. Hesychios the Priest Being attentive to God -Read and Discuss: 1 Kingdoms 3:1-21 Samuel refers to himself as a servant of the Lord in this passage. St. Ignatius said, \"Being a subordinate is the best way to become attentive...\" -Read and Discuss: Luke 10:38-42 -Read and Discuss: \"...The mind will begin to bear grudge and animosity against the demons, being in an incessant war. It will raise its justified wrath and hunt them, attack them, dissolve them. As for the things following beyond that, those you may find out yourself, with God's help, through your effort and the attention of your mind, keeping Jesus in your heart with His prayer: 'Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me.'\"-Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian How God is attentive to us -Discuss and Memorize: Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. -1 John 5:14 Being attentive during prayer -Read and Discuss: \"It is this war of attention and prayer on which both life and death of the soul depend. By attention that we keep our prayer safe and therefore we progress: if we do not have attention to keep it clear and we leave it unguarded, then it is inflected by evil thoughts and we become wicked and hopeless.\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian -Read and Discuss: \"The mind should guard the heart in the time of prayer and always stay inside it. From there, from the depths of the heart, it should then lift up the prayers to God. For once it tries inside the heart and tastes and is soothed--as the Lord is good!--then the mind will never want to leave the place of the heart. It will there repeat the words of Peter the apostle: 'It is wonderful for us to be here!' [Matthew 17:4, Mark 9:5, Luke 9:33] Then it will always wish to look inside the heart, remaining there and pushing aside and expelling all the concepts which are planted by the Devil. To those who have not realized this work of salvation and remain unaware of it, this will most of the times seem very hard and unpleasant. But those who have tasted its sweetness and enjoyed the pleasure inside the depths of their hearts, they all cry together with Paul: 'What could ever come between us and the love of God?' [Romans 8:38-39]\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian -Read and Discuss: But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. -Matthew 6:6 -Read and Discuss: \"...Cease your mind from anything ephemeral and vain. Press your chin on to your chest so that you can have your attention in yourself, with both eyes and mind. Hold your breath slightly to concentrate your mind and then, having all your mind there, try to find the place of your heart. In the beginning, what you will discover is darkness, much callousness and evil. But then, after having practiced this method of attention a lot, night and day, you will find--great wonder!--an incessant happiness! The mind, through struggle, will have finally reached the place of the heart, where you will see the things you have never seen or known. There you will see the heaven which is within you, inside the heart, and you will find yourself enlightened, full of all grace and virtue. From there on, if any kind of evil thought ever appears from any direction, before even being considered or take shape, you will immediately push it aside and dissolve it by the name of Jesus with his prayer: 'Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me.'\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian -Read and Discuss: \"As our Lord says, the evil thoughts that make a man unclean, [Matthew 15:19-20] and it is there where guard and attention is needed. Once weaknesses are totally diminished by the resistance of the heart, then the mind comes to yearn and seek the way to reconcile with God, extending its prayer and becoming further absorbed in it. Through this desire and prayer, the mind is strengthened and dismisses all the thoughts that have surrounded it in order to find their way into the heart, and fights them with prayer. Then starts a war and the evil demons resist with great distress, causing confusion and giddiness in the heart, exploiting its weaknesses. However, by the Name of Jesus Christ they are all dissolved and melt like wax in the fire.\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian Being attentive while reading scripture and the church fathers -Read and Discuss: Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. -1 Timothy 4:13 Being attentive to myself -Read and Discuss: \"Watchfulness is a continual fixing and halting of thought at the entrance to the heart…If we are conscientious in this, we can gain much experience and knowledge of spiritual warfare.\" -St. Hesychios the Priest -Read and Discuss: Beware lest there be a hidden thought in your heart, a transgression of the law, saying, 'The seventh year, the year of remission is at hand,' and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing, and he cry out to the Lord against you, and it be a great sin among you. -Deuteronomy 15:9 -Read and Discuss: \"Do not cease examining yourself as to whether you have sinned somehow in thought, whether somehow your tongue has slipped, running ahead of your mind, whether in the works of your hands you have done something inadvisable…Be attentive to yourself. This word is for you also when you are brilliantly successful, and all of your life is flowing like a stream…Are you proud of wealth? And do you have grand thoughts about your ancestors? And do you exult in your homeland and bodily beauty and the honors given you by all? Be attentive to yourself, mindful that you are mortal, that 'you are earth, and to earth you will return' [Genesis 3:19].\" -St. Basil -Read and Discuss: \"Do not be attentive to the flesh, nor pursue its good in every manner, health and beauty and enjoyment of pleasures and long life, nor admire wealth and reputation and power. As for those things that are of service to you in this temporary life, do not regard them as great…Know your own nature, that your body is mortal but your soul is immortal, and that our life is twofold in kind…Therefore be attentive to yourself, neither remaining in mortal things as if they were eternal, nor despising eternal things as if they were passing.\" -St. Basil Being attentive to my spiritual father and bishop -Read and Discuss: Incline your ear to the words of the wise and hear my word, and establish your heart that you may know they are good. -Proverbs 22:20 -Read and Discuss: \"As I understand, this virtue [of attention] abandoned us together with obedience, since it is the obedience one shows to his spiritual father which makes one truly free, leaving all the cares to him and staying away from the struggles of this world, whilst being a diligent artisan of this third way. (That is, if one finds a real spiritual father who has no error!) Thus he who dedicates himself and all the care to God and the spiritual father, by real obedience is no longer living his own life where he does his own wishes, but is free from any struggle of the world or his body. By what ephemeral thing then, can this person ever be spiritually defeated or enslaved, or what care or concern could he ever have? It is therefore by this way, together with obedience, that the devices and machinations of the demons to distract the mind towards many and various thoughts, are all defeated and dissolved. One's mind then stays free, and has plenty of space and chance to examine the thoughts brought by the demons, having a greater dexterity to expel them and offer his prayers to God with a clean heart. This is the beginning of the true way of life and those who do not make such a start are struggling in vain, even without knowing it.\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian -Read and discuss: “We should regard the bishop as we would the Lord Himself...Listen to the bishop, if you want God to listen to you.\" -St. Ignatius Being attentive to those closest to us-family and friends -Memorize and Discuss: So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God. -James 1:19-20 What should I avoid giving my attention to? -Memorize and Discuss: Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the troublesome; but his will is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night. -Psalm 1:1-2 -Read and Discuss: Evil ways are before a man, and he doesn't love to turn away from them, but it is necessary to turn away from a crooked and evil way. -Proverbs 22:17 -Read and Discuss: \"Do not be attentive to the flesh, nor pursue its good in every manner, health and beauty and enjoyment of pleasures and long life, nor admire wealth and reputation and power. As for those things that are of service to you in this temporary life, do not regard them as great…Know your own nature, that your body is mortal but your soul is immortal, and that our life is twofold in kind…Therefore be attentive to yourself, neither remaining in mortal things as if they were eternal, nor despising eternal things as if they were passing.\" -St. Basil How did Jesus show attentiveness to God the Father? -Read and Discuss: Luke 22:39-46 Attentiveness in the saints and church fathers -Read and Discuss: \"They [our Holy fathers] therefore left aside any other spiritual work and concentrated exclusively on guarding the heart, being confident that through this they would easily achieve all other virtues, whilst without it no virtue can be preserved. This practice was called by some fathers 'serenity of the heart', whilst others named it 'attention', others 'sobriety' and 'detainment', others 'examination of the thoughts' and 'guarding of the mind'; for they were all absorbed in this, and by this they were found worthy to accept the divine virtues.\" -Attributed to St. Symeon the New Theologian When do I show attentiveness? -Discussion What are some things in my life that pull my attention negatively? -Discussion How can I improve my attentiveness (to God, during prayer, while reading scripture, at church, to myself, to my spiritual father, to my family, to my friends)? -Read and Discuss: \"One type of watchfulness consists in closely scrutinizing every mental image or provocation: for only by means of a mental image can Satan fabricate an evil thought and insinuate this into the intellect in order to lead it astray. A second type of watchfulness consists in freeing the heart from all thoughts, keeping it profoundly silent and still, and in praying. A third type consists in continually and humbly calling upon the Lord Jesus Christ for help.\" -St. Hesychios the Priest In Conclusion -Read and Discuss: \"Towards God, it is an obligation to keep your conscience clear by avoiding the things you are aware that He neither likes nor give Him any joy. Towards your spiritual father you should do the things he orders you to do, doing nothing more and nothing less, living according to his plan and wish. As for the other people, you should keep your conscience clear by not doing to them any of the things you hate and do not wish them to do to you. Towards the earthly it is your obligation to restrain yourself from abuses, using them all appropriately, food as well as drinking and clothes.
