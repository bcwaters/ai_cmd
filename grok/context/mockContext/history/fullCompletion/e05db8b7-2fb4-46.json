It is written as:\n\n```latex\nf'(x) = \\lim_{{h \\to 0}} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n```\n\nThis LaTeX code uses several key elements:\n\n- `f'(x)` represents the derivative of the function $f$ with respect to $x$.\n- `\\lim_{{h \\to 0}}` denotes the limit as $h$ approaches 0.\n- `\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}` is the difference quotient used to define the derivative.\n\nRegarding the **marked-katex-extension**, it is designed to handle LaTeX syntax within Markdown documents. The marked-katex-extension should be able to render this LaTeX expression correctly, as it supports standard LaTeX syntax for mathematical expressions. Here's how it would typically be used in a Markdown document:\n\n```markdown\n$f'(x) = \\lim_{{h \\to 0}} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$\n```\n\nWhen processed by the marked-katex-extension, this Markdown should render the LaTeX expression into a formatted mathematical equation.\n\n@EOF@\n[LaTeX, derivative, limit, marked-katex-extension, Markdown, rendering, mathematical expressions]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":918,"completion_tokens":273,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1191,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":918,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
