These variables are typically included in scripts or configuration files to enhance the visual output in the terminal. Here's a breakdown of what each section represents:\n\n### ANSI Color Codes for Mac Terminal\nThis is a comment indicating that the following code block is tailored for use in a Mac terminal, though the codes are generally compatible with most modern terminals that support ANSI escape sequences.\n\n### Standard Colors\nThis section defines basic foreground color codes such as `color_green`, `color_red`, etc., and includes a `color_reset` code to revert to the terminal's default color.\n\n### Light Variants\nHere, lighter shades of the standard colors are defined, which are often used for a more vibrant or distinguishable output.\n\n### Dark Variants\nThese are darker shades of the standard colors, using 256-color mode for more precise color control.\n\n### Background Colors\nThis section includes codes for setting background colors in the terminal, from `color_background_green` to `color_background_grok`, offering a range of background color options.\n\nEach of these sections represents a logical grouping of color codes, but they would typically be part of a single script or configuration file rather than separate files.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Are you looking to use these color codes in a specific script or project?\n- Do you need help implementing these color codes in a terminal application?\n- Are you interested in learning more about how ANSI escape sequences work in terminals?\n\n@EOF@\nANSI color codes, terminal customization, Mac terminal, Bash scripting, foreground colors, background colors, light colors, dark colors, color reset, 256-color mode","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3115,"completion_tokens":351,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":3466,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3115,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
