Here's a breakdown of what this error means:\n\n- **spawnSync**: This is a synchronous method in Node.js used to spawn new processes. When `spawnSync` is used, it waits for the process to finish before returning the results.\n\n- **/bin/sh**: This refers to the shell that is being used to execute the command. `/bin/sh` is a common Unix shell.\n\n- **ENOBUFS**: This error code stands for \"Error No Buffers\". It indicates that the system ran out of buffer space when trying to execute the command. This typically happens when the command output is too large to be stored in the available buffers.\n\nTo resolve this issue, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Reduce Output**: If possible, modify the command to produce less output. For example, use filters or limit the amount of data returned.\n\n2. **Increase Buffer Size**: You can try increasing the buffer size used by Node.js. This can be done by setting the `maxBuffer` option when calling `spawnSync`. For example:\n   ```javascript\n   const { spawnSync } = require('child_process');\n   const result = spawnSync('/bin/sh', ['-c', 'your_command_here'], { maxBuffer: 1024 * 1024 * 10 }); // 10MB buffer\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Asynchronous Methods**: If the command produces a lot of output, consider using asynchronous methods like `child_process.spawn` instead of `spawnSync`. Asynchronous methods can handle larger outputs more effectively.\n\n4. **Stream Output**: Another approach is to stream the output of the command instead of capturing it all at once. This can be done by using `child_process.exec` with a callback to handle chunks of data as they become available.\n\nBy implementing one or more of these solutions, you should be able to mitigate the `ENOBUFS` error.\n\n@EOF@[Node.js, child_process, spawnSync, ENOBUFS, buffer, command, shell, error, solution, asynchronous, streaming]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":279,"completion_tokens":466,"total_tokens":745,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":279,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
