This feature distinguishes Maps from Objects, where keys are limited to strings and symbols.\n\n#### Keys of Any Type\n\n- **Any Type as Key**: Unlike Objects, Maps can use any value as a key, including objects, functions, and other primitive types like numbers and booleans. This flexibility is crucial for scenarios where you need to map complex keys to values.\n  \n  - **Example**: \n    ```javascript\n    let key1 = {};\n    let key2 = function() {};\n    let map = new Map();\n    map.set(key1, 'Value for object key');\n    map.set(key2, 'Value for function key');\n    console.log(map.get(key1)); // Output: Value for object key\n    console.log(map.get(key2)); // Output: Value for function key\n    ```\n\n- **Use Case**: When you need to use keys that can't be used as object properties, Maps are invaluable. For instance, if you need to use an object or a function as a key, a Map is the perfect solution.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```javascript\n    let objKey = { id: 1 };\n    let funcKey = function() { return 'Hello'; };\n    let userMap = new Map();\n    userMap.set(objKey, { name: 'Alice', age: 28 });\n    userMap.set(funcKey, { name: 'Bob', age: 34 });\n    console.log(userMap.get(objKey).name); // Output: Alice\n    console.log(userMap.get(funcKey).name); // Output: Bob\n    ```\n\n#### Usage: Keys That Can't Be Used as Object Properties\n\nMaps are particularly useful in scenarios where the key cannot be represented as a string or symbol, which are the only valid key types for Objects.\n\n- **Complex Keys**: If you need to use complex data structures as keys, such as other objects or arrays, Maps are your go-to choice.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```javascript\n    let complexKey1 = ['user', 1];\n    let complexKey2 = ['user', 2];\n    let dataMap = new Map();\n    dataMap.set(complexKey1, { name: 'Charlie', age: 22 });\n    dataMap.set(complexKey2, { name: 'David', age: 29 });\n    console.log(dataMap.get(complexKey1).name); // Output: Charlie\n    console.log(dataMap.get(complexKey2).name); // Output: David\n    ```\n\n- **Preserving Key Identity**: Maps maintain the identity of keys, meaning two different objects with the same properties will be treated as distinct keys.\n\n  - **Example**:\n    ```javascript\n    let obj1 = { id: 1 };\n    let obj2 = { id: 1 };\n    let identityMap = new Map();\n    identityMap.set(obj1, 'First object');\n    identityMap.set(obj2, 'Second object');\n    console.log(identityMap.get(obj1)); // Output: First object\n    console.log(identityMap.get(obj2)); // Output: Second object\n    ```\n\nBy allowing keys of any type and handling scenarios where keys can't be used as object properties, Maps provide a powerful tool for data organization and retrieval in JavaScript.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to use Maps in specific scenarios or perhaps about other data structures in JavaScript?\n\n@EOF@[Maps in JavaScript: Keys of Any Type, Usage: Keys That Can't Be Used as Object Properties, Complex Keys, Preserving Key Identity]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":634,"completion_tokens":757,"total_tokens":1391,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":634,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
