This suggests that the NGINX JavaScript module, which is necessary for using `js_path`, is not installed or enabled on your server.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install and enable the NGINX JavaScript module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install the NGINX JavaScript Module:**\n   On systems that use `apt` (like Ubuntu or Debian), you can install the module by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libnginx-mod-http-js\n   ```\n   For other systems, you may need to compile NGINX from source with the `--with-http_js_module` configuration option.\n\n2. **Enable the Module in NGINX:**\n   After installation, ensure that the module is enabled in your NGINX configuration. You might need to add or uncomment a line in your `nginx.conf` or a related configuration file to include the module:\n   ```nginx\n   load_module modules/ngx_http_js_module.so;\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart NGINX:**\n   Once the module is installed and enabled, restart NGINX to apply the changes:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart nginx\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, the `js_path` directive should be recognized, and your configuration should work as expected.\n\n@EOF@\n[NGINX, JavaScript, js_path, module installation, configuration, error resolution]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":315,"completion_tokens":313,"total_tokens":628,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":315,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
