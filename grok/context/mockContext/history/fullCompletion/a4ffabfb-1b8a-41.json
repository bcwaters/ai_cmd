Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Update Rule\n\nThe update rule for weights in a neural network using Stochastic Gradient Descent can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ w_{new} = w_{old} - \\eta \\cdot \\nabla J(w_{old}) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( w_{new} \\) is the updated weight.\n- \\( w_{old} \\) is the current weight.\n- \\( \\eta \\) is the learning rate.\n- \\( \\nabla J(w_{old}) \\) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight.\n\n### 2. Mini-batch Gradient Descent\n\nMini-batch gradient descent is a variation of SGD where the gradient is computed on a small subset of the data. The update rule is similar but calculated over a mini-batch:\n\n\\[ w_{new} = w_{old} - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\nabla J(w_{old}, x_i, y_i) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m \\) is the size of the mini-batch.\n- \\( \\nabla J(w_{old}, x_i, y_i) \\) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight, calculated for each example \\( (x_i, y_i) \\) in the mini-batch.\n\nWould you like to know more about how these equations are applied in practice or about other stochastic methods in neural networks?\n\n@EOF@[Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":303,"completion_tokens":313,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":616,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":303,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
