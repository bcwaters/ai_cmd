This example uses a pre-trained model to classify images as either AI-generated or not. Note that this is a simplified version and real-world applications might require more sophisticated models and preprocessing.\n\n```javascript\n// Import TensorFlow.js\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\n// Load the pre-trained model\nasync function loadModel() {\n  const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/your/model.json');\n  return model;\n}\n\n// Function to preprocess the image\nfunction preprocessImage(image) {\n  // Convert the image to a tensor\n  let tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(image).toFloat();\n  \n  // Normalize the tensor\n  const offset = tf.scalar(255.0);\n  tensor = tensor.div(offset);\n  \n  // Resize the tensor to match the model's input shape\n  const resized = tf.image.resizeBilinear(tensor, [224, 224]);\n  \n  // Expand the tensor to add a batch dimension\n  const batched = resized.expandDims(0);\n  \n  return batched;\n}\n\n// Function to predict if the image is AI-generated\nasync function predict(model, image) {\n  const processedImage = preprocessImage(image);\n  const prediction = await model.predict(processedImage);\n  \n  // Assuming the model outputs a single value between 0 and 1\n  // where 1 indicates AI-generated and 0 indicates not AI-generated\n  const result = prediction.dataSync()[0];\n  \n  processedImage.dispose();\n  prediction.dispose();\n  \n  return result > 0.5 ? 'AI-Generated' : 'Not AI-Generated';\n}\n\n// Main function to run the detection\nasync function main() {\n  const model = await loadModel();\n  const image = document.getElementById('myImage'); // Assuming you have an image element with id 'myImage'\n  \n  const result = await predict(model, image);\n  console.log('The image is:', result);\n}\n\n// Call the main function\nmain();\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- You'll need to replace `'path/to/your/model.json'` with the actual path to your pre-trained model.\n- The model's architecture and training data significantly affect the accuracy of detection. Ensure you use a model specifically trained for AI-generated image detection.\n- The threshold of `0.5` in the `predict` function can be adjusted based on your model's performance and requirements.\n- Make sure to handle any errors and manage memory properly in a production environment.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for detecting AI-generated images using TensorFlow.js. You might need to adjust it based on your specific model and requirements.@EOF@[TensorFlowJS, AI-generated images, image classification, pre-trained model, image preprocessing, JavaScript, machine learning, model prediction]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":432,"completion_tokens":586,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1018,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":432,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
