It states that if a function \\( f \\) is continuous on a closed interval \\([a, b]\\), and \\( F \\) is an antiderivative of \\( f \\) on \\([a, b]\\), then the definite integral of \\( f \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) can be calculated as the difference of the antiderivative \\( F \\) evaluated at the endpoints of the interval. Symbolically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a) \\]\n\nThis theorem is pivotal in understanding how the integral of a function over an interval relates to the function's antiderivative.\n\n### Non-Code Example for Non-Math Style\n\nIn everyday life, understanding the basics of cooking can be compared to learning a new language. Just as one needs to master vocabulary and grammar to communicate effectively, a cook must understand ingredients and techniques to create delicious meals. For instance, knowing how to properly saut√© vegetables can enhance their flavors and textures, much like how the right word choice can add nuance to a sentence. This analogy highlights the importance of foundational skills in any field, whether it's culinary arts or linguistics.\n\n@EOF@[FundamentalTheoremOfCalculus, antiderivative, integration, cooking, analogy, foundational skills]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":391,"completion_tokens":285,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":676,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":391,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
