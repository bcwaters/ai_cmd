Here's a more detailed look into its features based on the information provided earlier:\n\n### Orbital Characteristics\nUranus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 2.88 billion kilometers, taking approximately 84 Earth years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is nearly circular, and it's notable for its axial tilt, which is about 98 degrees. This extreme tilt causes Uranus to roll around the Sun on its side, leading to unusual seasonal patterns.\n\n### Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere of Uranus is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane. The methane in the upper atmosphere absorbs red light, giving Uranus its distinctive pale blue-green color. The atmosphere is also known for its relatively featureless appearance compared to other gas giants, with occasional storms and cloud bands visible.\n\n### Internal Structure\nBeneath its thick atmosphere, Uranus is believed to have a mantle composed of water, ammonia, and other ices surrounding a small rocky core. The planet's internal heat source is less significant than that of other gas giants, which contributes to its relatively calm atmospheric activity.\n\n### Moons and Rings\nUranus has 27 known moons, the largest of which are Titania and Oberon. These moons are composed of ice and rock. Uranus also has a faint ring system discovered in 1977, composed of dark particles and dust. The rings are much less prominent than those of Saturn but are still an interesting feature of the planet.\n\n### Exploration\nUranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1986. This mission provided invaluable data about Uranus's atmosphere, moons, and rings. Future missions to Uranus are being considered, but none are currently planned, leaving much of the planet's mysteries yet to be explored.\n\nUranus's unique tilt, its pale blue-green hue, and its position as the second outermost gas giant in our solar system make it a subject of continuous interest and study in the field of planetary science.\n\n@EOF@\nUranus, solar system, pale blue-green planet, axial tilt, 84-year orbit, atmosphere, hydrogen, helium, methane, moons, Titania, Oberon, rings, Voyager 2, exploration, future missions","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":925,"completion_tokens":489,"total_tokens":1414,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":925,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
