Here's a breakdown of what the script does:\n\n# AI_CMD / GrokDOC Bash Script Overview\n\nThe script is structured to provide an interactive environment where users can input prompts and receive outputs from an AI system. Here are the key components and functionalities:\n\n## Initialization\n- The script starts by changing to its own directory and setting up color variables based on the operating system (Linux or macOS).\n\n## User Interface\n- A visually appealing ASCII art logo is displayed using color-coded text.\n- The script enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input until the user types \"exit\".\n\n## User Commands\nThe script supports several commands that can be entered by the user:\n\n### Context Management\n- **context**: Allows setting the AI's memory to a previous conversation.\n- **new**: Starts a new conversation.\n\n### Configuration\n- **depth**: Sets the context depth for better memory retention (1 to 10000 words).\n- **role**: Selects the role the AI should assume (e.g., software, teaching, writing).\n\n### File Operations\n- **file**: Loads a file into the AI's context.\n- **paste**: Pastes content from the clipboard into the prompt.\n- **save**: Saves the current context as a Markdown file.\n- **open**: Opens the directory containing saved readmes.\n- **review**: Opens the current chat history in vim for editing.\n\n### Special Modes\n- **treeMode**: Generates a set of organized documents from the prompt.\n- **browserMode** and **terminalMode**: Switches between different output modes.\n\n## Execution\n- When a prompt is entered (and it's not one of the special commands), the script runs a Node.js script (`grok.js`) with the provided prompt and any additional flags set by the user's previous commands.\n- A spinner is displayed while waiting for the Node.js script to complete.\n\n## Visual Elements\n- The script uses colored text and borders to enhance the user experience.\n- It displays the current context ID and settings before each prompt.\n\nThis script seems to be part of a larger system that integrates with a Node.js backend (`grok.js`) to process user prompts and generate responses, potentially using AI technology. The script focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with this backend system.\n\n@EOF@\n[bash-script, AI_CMD, GrokDOC, interactive-CLI, user-interface, context-management, configuration, file-operations, special-modes, Node.js-integration, ASCII-art, colored-output]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3548,"completion_tokens":541,"total_tokens":4089,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3548,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
