Then, initialize a new Node.js project and install Express:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install express\n```\n\n### Step 2: Creating the Server Script\n\nCreate a file named `server.js`. Here's a basic setup to handle JSON endpoints with suppressed logs:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.argv[2] || 3000; // Command-line argument for port, default to 3000\n\n// Suppress Express logs\napp.set('logger', false);\n\n// Middleware to parse JSON\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Example JSON endpoint\napp.get('/fruits', (req, res) => {\n    const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];\n    res.json(fruits);\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    // Suppress console.log\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n        console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Step 3: Running the Script\n\nTo run the script and specify the port, use:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js 4000\n```\n\nThis will start the server on port 4000, and logs will be suppressed in a production environment.\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Endpoint\n\nYou can test the `/fruits` endpoint using a tool like `curl`:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:4000/fruits\n```\n\nThis should return the JSON response `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`.\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n\n- Do you have a favorite fruit?\n- Are you interested in learning about the nutritional benefits of these fruits?\n- Would you like to know about exotic fruits?\n\n### Overview of Fruits\n\n#### Nutritional Benefits\n\nFruits like apples and bananas are rich in essential nutrients. Apples are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, while bananas provide potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C.\n\n#### Health Benefits\n\nApples can help in digestion due to their fiber content, and bananas can aid in muscle function due to their high potassium levels.\n\n#### Culinary Uses\n\nApples can be used in pies, sauces, and salads, whereas bananas are great in smoothies, desserts, and as a snack.\n\n#### Cultural Significance\n\nApples have a long history in folklore and are often associated with health and knowledge. Bananas are a staple in many tropical diets.\n\n#### Varieties\n\nThere are numerous varieties of apples like Gala, Fuji, and Granny Smith, and bananas have types like Cavendish and Plantain.\n\n#### Growing and Harvesting\n\nApples are grown in temperate zones and harvested in the fall, while bananas are tropical and harvested year-round.\n\n#### Nutritional Benefits Environment\n\nBoth fruits contribute to a healthy diet and can be part of sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n@EOF@\n[Express, Node.js, server setup, JSON endpoint, suppress logs, command-line arguments, fruits, apple, banana, nutritional benefits, health benefits, culinary uses, cultural significance, varieties, growing and harvesting]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":290,"completion_tokens":662,"total_tokens":952,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":290,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
