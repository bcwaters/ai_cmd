Here's why:\n\n- **Ease of Setup**: Jest is easy to set up and integrate into your Node.js project.\n- **Feature-Rich**: It comes with features like mocking, code coverage, and snapshot testing out of the box.\n- **Community Support**: It has a large community and is actively maintained by Facebook, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest JavaScript features.\n- **Fast and Safe**: Jest runs tests in parallel, making it fast, and it provides an isolated environment for each test, which is crucial for unit testing.\n\nTo get started with Jest in your project, you can simply install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev jest\n```\n\nThen, update your `package.json` to use Jest as your test script:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"jest\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can write your tests in files that end with `.test.js` or `.spec.js`. Here's a simple example of how to test a utility function:\n\n```javascript\n// util.js\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = add;\n\n// util.test.js\nconst add = require('./util');\n\ntest('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {\n  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n});\n```\n\nRun your tests with `npm test`, and Jest will execute them.\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n- Have you used any testing frameworks before?\n- Are there specific features in Jest that you're interested in learning more about?\n- Do you need help setting up Jest in your project?\n\n@EOF@\n[JavaScript, Node.js, Unit Testing, Jest, Test Framework, npm, package.json, Test Script, Code Example]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":224,"completion_tokens":389,"total_tokens":613,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":224,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
