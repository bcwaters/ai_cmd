However, if you need specialized handling:\n\n- **remark-katex**: This plugin uses KaTeX, a fast LaTeX renderer, which supports a broad subset of LaTeX. It's particularly good for rendering math on the web due to its speed.\n\n- **remark-mathjax**: This uses MathJax, another popular LaTeX renderer, which supports a larger subset of LaTeX syntax compared to KaTeX. It's more suitable if you need advanced LaTeX features.\n\n- **remark-rehype**: While not specifically for LaTeX, it converts Markdown to HTML, and when combined with rehype-katex or rehype-mathjax, it can render LaTeX math in HTML.\n\nEach of these options can be integrated into a Markdown processing pipeline to handle LaTeX syntax beyond what `remark-math` might cover, depending on your specific needs.\n\n@EOF@\n[LaTeX, remark, plugins, KaTeX, MathJax, rehype, Markdown, rendering, syntax, math]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":334,"completion_tokens":249,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":583,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":334,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
