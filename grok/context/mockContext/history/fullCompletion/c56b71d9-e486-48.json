Here, we'll delve deeper into the aspects of customizing LaTeX rendering, focusing on the information previously mentioned.\n\n#### Configuration of MathJax\n\nMathJax is a powerful tool for rendering LaTeX on the web, and its configuration allows for extensive customization. Here's a more detailed look at how to set up and tweak the MathJax configuration:\n\n```javascript\n// mathjax-config.js\nMathJax = {\n  // Defines delimiters for inline and display math\n  tex: {\n    inlineMath: [['$', '$'], [\"\\\\(\", \"\\\\)\"]],\n    displayMath: [['$$', '$$'], [\"\\\\[\", \"\\\\]\"]],\n    // Allows for additional LaTeX packages or custom commands\n    packages: {'[+]': ['base', 'ams', 'autoload', 'require']},\n    // Custom macros can be defined here\n    macros: {\n      RR: '{\\\\bf R}',\n      bold: ['{\\\\bf #1}', 1]\n    }\n  },\n  // SVG output configuration\n  svg: {\n    fontCache: 'global', // 'global' or 'local'\n    // Additional SVG-specific settings\n    scale: 1.2, // Adjusts the scale of the rendered equations\n    minScale: 0.5, // Minimum scale allowed\n  },\n  // Options for other output formats like HTML-CSS\n  'HTML-CSS': {\n    scale: 110, // Adjusts the scale of the rendered equations\n    availableFonts: ['STIX', 'TeX'], // List of fonts to use\n  },\n  // Startup configuration\n  startup: {\n    typeset: false // Delays typeset until page load\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### Explanation of Key Configuration Options\n\n- **Delimiters (`inlineMath`, `displayMath`)**: These settings define how LaTeX expressions are recognized within your content. You can customize these to match your preferred syntax or to avoid conflicts with other markup languages.\n\n- **Packages and Macros**: The `packages` option allows you to include additional LaTeX packages, enhancing the functionality of your expressions. `macros` let you define custom commands, which can simplify writing complex expressions or enforce consistency across your documents.\n\n- **Output Configuration (`svg`, `HTML-CSS`)**: These settings control how the equations are rendered. `svg` is often preferred for its high quality and scalability, while `HTML-CSS` might be better for older browsers. You can adjust scaling and font settings to match your design requirements.\n\n- **Startup Configuration**: The `startup` option can be used to delay the typesetting of equations until the page has loaded, which can improve the perceived performance of your site.\n\n#### Practical Implementation\n\nTo implement these customizations, you would typically include the configuration file in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <script>\n    window.MathJax = {\n      // Your MathJax configuration goes here\n    };\n  </script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"MathJax-script\" async\n    src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-svg.js\">\n  </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <!-- Your content with LaTeX expressions -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Troubleshooting Common Customization Issues\n\n- **Equations Not Rendering as Expected**: Verify that your configuration is correctly loaded and that the delimiters match those used in your content. Also, check for syntax errors in your LaTeX expressions.\n\n- **Performance Issues with Customization**: If your custom settings cause performance issues, consider reducing the complexity of your equations or using a different output format. For instance, switching from SVG to HTML-CSS might improve load times on certain devices.\n\n- **Inconsistent Rendering Across Browsers**: If you're using `HTML-CSS` output, ensure that the fonts you've specified are available across all target browsers. SVG output is generally more consistent but may have performance implications.\n\nBy carefully configuring MathJax and understanding the impact of each setting, you can achieve a high degree of customization in rendering LaTeX expressions, enhancing both the aesthetics and functionality of your mathematical content.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2137,"completion_tokens":867,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":3004,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2137,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
