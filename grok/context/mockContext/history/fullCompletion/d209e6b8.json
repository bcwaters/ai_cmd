When using `marked` to render markdown to HTML, any `<script>` tags included in the markdown text will be converted to HTML `<script>` tags. This can pose a security risk if the input is not sanitized, as it could lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.\n\nTo safely handle `<script>` tags, you should use a separate sanitization library like DOMPurify after the markdown has been converted to HTML. This ensures that any potentially harmful scripts are removed or neutralized before the HTML is rendered in a web browser.\n\n@EOF@\n[marked, markdown parser, script tags, XSS risk, HTML conversion, sanitization, DOMPurify, security]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":355,"completion_tokens":176,"total_tokens":531,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":355,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
