For two coprime moduli $m_1$ and $m_2$, if:\n   \\[\n   n \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}\n   \\]\n   then there exists a unique solution modulo $m_1 m_2$:\n   \\[\n   n \\equiv x \\pmod{m_1 m_2}\n   \\]\n   where $x$ can be found using:\n   \\[\n   x = a_1 M_2 y_2 + a_2 M_1 y_1\n   \\]\n   with $M_1 = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1}$, $M_2 = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_2}$, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to:\n   \\[\n   M_1 y_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_2 y_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of Divisors Function:**\n   The sum of the divisors of a number $n$, denoted as $\\sigma(n)$, is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d\n   \\]\n   where the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n\n5. **Perfect Number:**\n   A number $n$ is called perfect if it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. A perfect number can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n = \\sigma(n) - n\n   \\]\n   where $\\sigma(n)$ is the sum of all divisors of $n$.@EOF@[number theory, Euler's Totient, Fermat's Little Theorem, Chinese Remainder Theorem, sum of divisors, perfect number, KaTeX equations]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":626,"completion_tokens":647,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1273,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":626,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
