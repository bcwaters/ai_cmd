The conversion rules are as follows:\n\n- `false` is converted to `0`.\n- `true` is converted to `1`.\n\nTherefore, if you add two boolean values together, the result will be based on these numeric conversions. Let's see an example:\n\n```javascript\nlet result = true + true;\nconsole.log(result); // Output: 2\n```\n\nIn this case, `true + true` is equivalent to `1 + 1`, which results in `2`.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: **Yes, in JavaScript, `true + true` equals `2`.**\n\n@EOF@\n[boolean, addition, JavaScript, true, false, numeric conversion, implicit conversion,]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":742,"completion_tokens":168,"total_tokens":910,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":742,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
