Euler's Totient Function (15 minutes)\n- **Definition**: Explain that Euler's Totient Function, $\\varphi(n)$, counts the positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.\n- **Formula**: \n  \\[\n  \\varphi(n) = n \\prod_{p|n} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)\n  \\]\n  where the product is over all distinct prime numbers $p$ dividing $n$.\n- **Example**: Calculate $\\varphi(12)$.\n\n#### 2. Fermat's Little Theorem (15 minutes)\n- **Statement**: If $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, we have:\n  \\[\n  a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\n  \\]\n- **Application in Cryptography**: Discuss how this theorem is used in the RSA algorithm.\n- **Example**: Verify Fermat's Little Theorem for $a = 2$ and $p = 7$.\n\n#### 3. Chinese Remainder Theorem (15 minutes)\n- **Statement**: If one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer $n$ by several pairwise coprime integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of $n$ by the product of these integers.\n- **Formula**: Given $n \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1}$ and $n \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}$, there exists a unique solution modulo $m_1m_2$:\n  \\[\n  n \\equiv x \\pmod{m_1m_2}\n  \\]\n  where $x = a_1m_2y_2 + a_2m_1y_1$, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to $m_1y_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_2}$ and $m_2y_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_1}$.\n- **Example**: Solve the system $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n#### 4. Sum of Divisors Function (15 minutes)\n- **Definition**: The sum of the divisors of a number $n$, denoted as $\\sigma(n)$, is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d\n  \\]\n- **Example**: Calculate $\\sigma(6)$.\n\n### Application in Cryptography (60 minutes)\n\n#### RSA Encryption (30 minutes)\n- **Overview**: Introduce the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.\n- **Key Generation**: Explain the process of generating public and private keys using Euler's Totient Function.\n- **Encryption and Decryption**: Demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt a message using the RSA algorithm.\n- **Example**: Encrypt and decrypt a simple message.\n\n#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (30 minutes)\n- **Overview**: Introduce the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.\n- **Process**: Explain the steps involved in the key exchange using modular arithmetic.\n- **Example**: Walk through a simple example of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\n### Conclusion and Q&A (15 minutes)\n- **Recap**: Summarize the key points covered in the lesson.\n- **Q&A**: Allow time for students to ask questions and clarify any doubts.\n\n## Assessment\n- **Homework**: Assign exercises related to Euler's Totient Function, Fermat's Little Theorem, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n- **Quiz**: A short quiz on the concepts covered in the lesson and their applications in cryptography.\n\n## Additional Resources\n- **Books**: \"An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers\" by G.H. Hardy and E.M. Wright.\n- **Online Resources**: Khan Academy's Number Theory course, Crypto101.io for cryptography basics.\n\n@EOF@\n[Number Theory, Cryptography, Euler's Totient Function, Fermat's Little Theorem, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Sum of Divisors, RSA Encryption, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, High School, Lesson Plan]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":753,"completion_tokens":1023,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1776,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":753,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
