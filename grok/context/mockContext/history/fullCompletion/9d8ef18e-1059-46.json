Let's delve deeper into its properties and representations.\n\n## Standard Form and Parabola\n\nIn its standard form, \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\), the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = 4\\). This equation describes a parabola, a U-shaped curve that opens upwards since \\(a > 0\\).\n\n## Factored Form\n\nThe equation can be factored to reveal its roots:\n\n\\[\ny = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\nThis factored form, \\(y = (x - h)^2 + k\\), where \\(h = 2\\) and \\(k = 0\\), directly shows that the vertex of the parabola is at the point \\((2, 0)\\). The vertex form of a quadratic equation is particularly useful for identifying the minimum or maximum point of the parabola.\n\n## Vertex and Axis of Symmetry\n\n- **Vertex**: The vertex of this parabola is at \\((2, 0)\\). This point represents the minimum value of \\(y\\) since the parabola opens upwards.\n- **Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry for this parabola is the vertical line \\(x = 2\\). This line divides the parabola into two symmetric halves.\n\n## Roots and Intercepts\n\n- **Roots**: Since the equation can be written as \\(y = (x - 2)^2\\), the root of the equation is \\(x = 2\\). This is a double root, meaning the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point.\n- **Y-intercept**: The y-intercept occurs when \\(x = 0\\). Substituting \\(x = 0\\) into the equation gives \\(y = 0^2 - 4 \\cdot 0 + 4 = 4\\). Therefore, the y-intercept is at \\((0, 4)\\).\n\n## Graphical Representation\n\nThe graph of this quadratic equation would show a parabola that:\n- Starts at the y-intercept \\((0, 4)\\).\n- Reaches its minimum at the vertex \\((2, 0)\\).\n- Continues to rise symmetrically on both sides of the axis of symmetry \\(x = 2\\).\n\n## Applications\n\nQuadratic equations like this one are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics to model phenomena where the relationship between variables is not linear. For instance, they can describe the trajectory of a projectile, the shape of a satellite dish, or the profit function of a business.\n\nIn summary, the quadratic equation \\(y = x^2 - 4x + 4\\) provides a rich example of how a simple mathematical expression can be analyzed to reveal its geometric properties and practical applications.@EOF@[Standard Form and Parabola, Factored Form, Vertex and Axis of Symmetry, Roots and Intercepts, Graphical Representation, Applications]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":691,"completion_tokens":618,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1309,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":691,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
