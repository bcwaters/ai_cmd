The general form of a summation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\n$$\n\nThis represents the sum of the elements \\(a_i\\) from \\(i=1\\) to \\(i=n\\).\n\n### Softmax Function\n\nThe softmax function is widely used in machine learning, particularly in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification. It is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}}\n$$\n\nHere, \\(z_i\\) is the input to the output layer, and \\(k\\) is the number of classes.\n\n### Pythagoras' Theorem\n\nPythagoras' theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. It is expressed as:\n\n$$\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n$$\n\nwhere \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the legs of the triangle, and \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nThese equations illustrate the use of LaTeX to represent mathematical concepts clearly and precisely.@EOF@[summation, softmax, pythagoras, latex, machine_learning, geometry]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":675,"completion_tokens":289,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":964,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":675,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
