It is similar to a shortcut on Windows or an alias on macOS. Symlinks are used in Unix-like operating systems to create a flexible way to manage files and directories.\n\n- **Creation**: Symlinks can be created using the `ln -s` command in Unix-like systems. For example, `ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/symlink` creates a symlink at `/path/to/symlink` that points to `/path/to/original`.\n- **Usage**: When you access a symlink, you are actually accessing the file or directory it points to. This can be useful for organizing files or maintaining compatibility between different parts of a system.\n- **Types**: There are two types of links in Unix systems: hard links and symbolic links. Hard links are direct pointers to the data on the disk, while symbolic links are more like shortcuts, pointing to the file name.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to create symlinks, the differences between hard and symbolic links, or any specific use cases for symlinks?\n\n@EOF@[symlink, symbolic link, Unix, file management, shortcut, ln -s, hard link,]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":189,"completion_tokens":266,"total_tokens":455,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":189,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
