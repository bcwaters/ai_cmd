This flexibility sets them apart from objects, which can only have strings or symbols as keys.\n\n#### Detailed Description\n- **Key Types**: Unlike objects, Maps can use any value as a key, including objects, functions, and any other primitive types. This is particularly useful when you need to use complex objects as keys.\n- **Order Preservation**: Maps maintain the insertion order of the keys. This means that when you iterate over a Map, the key-value pairs are returned in the order they were inserted.\n- **Size Property**: Maps have a `size` property that returns the number of key-value pairs in the Map, making it easy to check the Map's length.\n\n#### Usage Scenarios\n- **Dynamic Key-Value Storage**: When you need a collection where keys can be of any type and you need to frequently add or remove entries.\n- **Preserving Order**: When the order in which data was added matters, such as in a history log or a queue system.\n- **Avoiding Key Collisions**: When using objects as keys in an object would lead to key collisions or loss of data due to how JavaScript handles object equality.\n\n#### Example with Detailed Explanation\n```javascript\nlet map = new Map();\n\n// Adding entries to the Map\nmap.set('key1', 'value1'); // Adding a string key\nmap.set(42, 'answer'); // Adding a number key\nmap.set({ name: 'John' }, 'person'); // Adding an object key\n\n// Accessing values\nconsole.log(map.get('key1')); // Output: value1\nconsole.log(map.get(42)); // Output: answer\nconsole.log(map.get({ name: 'John' })); // Output: undefined, because object keys are compared by reference\n\n// Checking size\nconsole.log(map.size); // Output: 3\n\n// Iterating over the Map\nfor (let [key, value] of map) {\n    console.log(key, value);\n}\n// Output:\n// key1 value1\n// 42 answer\n// [object Object] person\n\n// Deleting an entry\nmap.delete(42);\nconsole.log(map.size); // Output: 2\n```\n\n#### Additional Features\n- **Methods**: Maps come with several useful methods like `clear()` to remove all key-value pairs, `has(key)` to check if a key exists, and `keys()`, `values()`, and `entries()` for iteration.\n- **Performance**: In general, Maps are optimized for frequent additions and deletions, making them more efficient than objects for these operations in many scenarios.\n\nWould you like to explore more about how Maps can be used in specific applications or scenarios?\n\n@EOF@[Maps in JavaScript, Key Types, Order Preservation, Size Property, Usage Scenarios, Dynamic Key-Value Storage, Preserving Order, Avoiding Key Collisions, Example with Detailed Explanation, Additional Features, Performance]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":632,"completion_tokens":622,"total_tokens":1254,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":632,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
