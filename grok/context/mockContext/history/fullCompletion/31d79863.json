Key features include:\n\n- **Sequential Processing**: Processes input data sequentially, maintaining an internal state (memory) that captures information about previous inputs.\n- **Variants**: Includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs.\n- **Applications**: Suitable for tasks like time series prediction, speech recognition, and text generation.\n\nExample models: Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU.\n\n## 3. **Sparse Transformer Architecture**\n\nSparse Transformers aim to improve the efficiency of traditional Transformers by reducing computational complexity. Key features include:\n\n- **Sparse Attention Patterns**: Instead of attending to all positions in the input sequence, the model attends to a subset, reducing the computational load.\n- **Scalability**: Allows for processing longer sequences and larger models with less memory and computational resources.\n- **Applications**: Useful in scenarios where efficiency is critical, such as real-time processing or handling very large datasets.\n\nExample models: Sparse Transformer, Reformer, Longformer.\n\n@EOF@[Transformer Architecture, Recurrent Neural Networks, Sparse Transformer Architecture]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":951,"completion_tokens":392,"total_tokens":1343,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":951,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
