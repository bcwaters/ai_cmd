You can do this by including the script in your HTML file or by using npm/yarn if you're using a module bundler.\n\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest\"></script>\n   ```\n\n2. **Load a Pre-trained Model**: You can use a pre-trained model like MobileNet for image classification. Load it using the following code:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const mobilenet = await tf.loadLayersModel('https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_0.25_224/model.json');\n   ```\n\n3. **Prepare the Image**: Convert the image to a tensor that the model can process. This typically involves resizing the image and normalizing its pixel values.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const image = document.getElementById('myImage');\n   const tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(image)\n     .resizeNearestNeighbor([224, 224])\n     .toFloat()\n     .expandDims();\n   const normalizedTensor = tensor.div(255);\n   ```\n\n4. **Make Predictions**: Use the model to make predictions on the prepared image.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const predictions = await mobilenet.predict(normalizedTensor);\n   const topK = 5;\n   const values = await predictions.data();\n   const indices = Array.from(values)\n     .map((value, index) => ({value, index}))\n     .sort((a, b) => b.value - a.value)\n     .slice(0, topK);\n\n   indices.forEach((prediction) => {\n     console.log(`Class: ${prediction.index}, Probability: ${prediction.value}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n5. **Display Results**: You can display these predictions on your web page, perhaps by updating the DOM with the top predictions and their probabilities.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const resultsDiv = document.getElementById('results');\n   resultsDiv.innerHTML = indices.map(prediction => \n     `<p>Class: ${prediction.index}, Probability: ${prediction.value}</p>`\n   ).join('');\n   ```\n\nThis setup provides a basic framework for image classification using TensorFlow.js. You can further customize this by training your own model or integrating with other TensorFlow.js functionalities.\n\n@EOF@\n[TensorFlow.js, image classification, MobileNet, pre-trained model, predictions, JavaScript, web application, machine learning, model loading, image processing]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":315,"completion_tokens":536,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":851,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":315,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
