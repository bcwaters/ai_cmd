For example, to ignore a file named `config.ini`, add:\n     ```\n     config.ini\n     ```\n   - Ensure the file path is relative to the `.gitignore` file's location.\n\n3. **Save the `.gitignore` File:**\n   - After adding the file pattern, save the `.gitignore` file.\n\n4. **Apply Changes to Already Tracked Files:**\n   - If the file you want to ignore is already tracked by Git, you'll need to remove it from the repository's index without deleting it from your working directory. Use:\n     ```bash\n     git rm --cached config.ini\n     ```\n   - Then, commit the change:\n     ```bash\n     git commit -m \"Remove config.ini from repository\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify the Ignored File:**\n   - Use `git status` to ensure that the file is no longer tracked and is now ignored:\n     ```bash\n     git status\n     ```\n\n### Example `.gitignore` Content\n\n```plaintext\n# Ignore a specific file\nconfig.ini\n\n# Ignore all .txt files\n*.txt\n\n# Ignore the logs directory\nlogs/\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage which files Git should ignore in your project.\n\n@EOF@\n[gitignore, include file, Git repository, patterns, commit, text editor, ignore files, remove files, git status]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":513,"completion_tokens":377,"total_tokens":890,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":513,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
