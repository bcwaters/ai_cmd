Here are a few options:\n\n### Using `sleep infinity`\n\nThis command will keep the container running indefinitely. It's useful for diagnostics because it doesn't consume much resources.\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d --name diagnostic-container your-image-name sleep infinity\n```\n\n### Using `/bin/bash`\n\nIf the image has `/bin/bash`, you can start the container in an interactive mode to diagnose issues:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -it --name diagnostic-container your-image-name /bin/bash\n```\n\n### Using `/bin/sh`\n\nIf `/bin/bash` is not available, you can use `/bin/sh`:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -it --name diagnostic-container your-image-name /bin/sh\n```\n\n### Using `tail -f /dev/null`\n\nAnother command that keeps the container running without consuming much resources:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d --name diagnostic-container your-image-name tail -f /dev/null\n```\n\nChoose the command that best fits your diagnostic needs. If you need to attach to a running container later, you can use `docker exec`:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker exec -it diagnostic-container /bin/bash\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nsudo docker exec -it diagnostic-container /bin/sh\n```\n\n@EOF@\ndocker, container, run, diagnostic, sleep, bash, sh, tail, exec, interactive","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":844,"completion_tokens":289,"total_tokens":1133,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":844,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
