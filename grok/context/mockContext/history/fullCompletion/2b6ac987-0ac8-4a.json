You can use software like Audacity or your system's sound settings to monitor the input levels.\n\n2. **Adjusting Settings**: If the audio levels are too low or too high, adjust your microphone sensitivity or gain. Most operating systems allow you to do this through the sound settings.\n\n3. **Quality Check**: Listen to a recording to ensure the audio quality meets your needs. Adjust settings if necessary.\n\n4. **Testing Environment**: Make sure to test in the environment where you will be using the audio to account for background noise.\n\nRemember, clear audio communication is crucial for effective interaction.\n\n@EOF@\n[audio testing, microphone check, audio quality, settings adjustment]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":271,"completion_tokens":174,"total_tokens":445,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":271,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
