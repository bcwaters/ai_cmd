The head is represented by the top triangular shapes, with the eyes as the smaller triangles within. The body is shown as a rectangular prism, with some depth added by the angled lines at the bottom.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments or if you have any other ASCII art requests!@EOF@[3D ASCII art, Grok representation, head shape, eyes, body, rectangular prism, depth, angled lines]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":456,"completion_tokens":234,"total_tokens":690,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":456,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
