Here are some key points to consider:\n\n- **Shelf Life:** Unopened butter can last in the refrigerator for up to one month past the printed date. Once opened, it typically lasts about 2-3 weeks in the fridge.\n- **Signs of Spoilage:** Spoiled butter may have a sour smell, an off taste, or visible mold. If you notice any of these signs, it's best to discard the butter.\n- **Storage:** To extend its shelf life, keep butter in an airtight container to minimize exposure to air and potential contaminants.\n- **Freezing:** Butter can be frozen to prolong its usability. When stored in the freezer, it can last up to 6-9 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before use.\n\nUnderstanding these factors will help you manage butter's freshness and safety.@EOF@[butter, spoilage, shelf life, storage, freezing, refrigerator, mold, sour smell, off taste, airtight container]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1336,"completion_tokens":207,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1543,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1336,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
