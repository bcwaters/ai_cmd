In the context of the I Ching, this symbolizes the fundamental needs and resources that sustain individuals and communities.\n- **Community Resource**: The well is often a communal resource, shared among members of a village or town. This reflects the importance of shared resources and collective well-being.\n\n### Maintenance\n- **Need for Upkeep**: Just as a physical well requires regular maintenance to remain functional, the hexagram emphasizes the importance of maintaining the resources and support systems that sustain us.\n- **Renewal and Care**: The well must be cleaned and cared for to ensure it continues to provide. This extends to the idea that personal and communal resources need ongoing attention and care.\n\n## Key Lines and Their Meanings\n\n### Line 1: \"The town may be changed, but the well cannot be changed.\"\n- **Stability and Permanence**: This line highlights the enduring nature of essential resources.
