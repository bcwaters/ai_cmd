A common activation function is the sigmoid function, which can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n$$\n\nThis function squashes the input to a range between 0 and 1.\n\n### Softmax Function\n\nThe softmax function is often used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification. It is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^K e^{z_j}}\n$$\n\nwhere $z_i$ is the input to the output layer and $K$ is the number of classes.\n\n### Batch Normalization\n\nBatch normalization normalizes the output of a layer to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The formula for batch normalization is:\n\n$$\n\\hat{x}_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu_B}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_B^2 + \\epsilon}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_B$ and $\\sigma_B^2$ are the mean and variance of the mini-batch, and $\\epsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero.\n\n### Gradient Descent\n\nGradient descent is used to minimize the loss function during training. The update rule for weights in gradient descent is:\n\n$$\nw_{new} = w_{old} - \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w}$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.\n\n### Jacobian Matrix\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is used in backpropagation to compute the gradient of a vector-valued function. For a function $\\mathbf{f}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$, the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThese equations provide a deeper understanding of how linear algebra and calculus are applied in the context of neural networks.@EOF@activationfunctions, sigmoidfunction, softmaxfunction, batchnormalization, gradientdescent, jacobianmatrix","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":700,"completion_tokens":516,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":700,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
