Here's an example of how to start a container with SSH enabled:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name my-container -p 2222:22 my-image-name\n```\n\n- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.\n- `--name my-container` gives the container a specific name.\n- `-p 2222:22` maps port 2222 on the host to port 22 in the container, which is the default SSH port.\n- `my-image-name` should be replaced with the name of your Docker image.\n\n### Step 2: Install and Configure SSH in the Container\n\nIf your Docker image does not have SSH installed, you'll need to install it and configure it. You can do this by executing commands inside the running container:\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it my-container bash\n```\n\nOnce inside the container, install SSH if it's not already installed:\n\n```bash\napt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server\n```\n\nStart the SSH service:\n\n```bash\nservice ssh start\n```\n\nSet a root password for SSH access (if needed):\n\n```bash\necho 'root:yourpassword' | chpasswd\n```\n\nExit the container:\n\n```bash\nexit\n```\n\n### Step 3: SSH into the Container\n\nNow that SSH is set up, you can SSH into the container from your host machine:\n\n```bash\nssh root@localhost -p 2222\n```\n\nReplace `yourpassword` with the password you set for the root user.\n\nBy following these steps, you can start a Docker container and SSH into it for further interaction and management.\n\n@EOF@\n[Docker, SSH, Container, StartContainer, InstallSSH, ConfigureSSH, SSHIntoContainer]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":549,"completion_tokens":400,"total_tokens":949,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":549,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
