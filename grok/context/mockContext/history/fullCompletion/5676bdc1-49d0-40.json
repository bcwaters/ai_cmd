The slope determines how steep the line is.\n- **b** is the y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This is the value of y when x is zero.\n\n## Slope (m)\nThe slope \\( m \\) is calculated as the change in y divided by the change in x, often written as:\n\\[ m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\]\nA positive slope means the line is increasing from left to right, a negative slope means it's decreasing, and a slope of zero means the line is horizontal.\n\n### Examples of Slope:\n- **Positive Slope:** \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) (as x increases, y increases)\n- **Negative Slope:** \\( y = -3x + 5 \\) (as x increases, y decreases)\n- **Zero Slope:** \\( y = 4 \\) (a horizontal line where y does not change with x)\n\n## Y-Intercept (b)\nThe y-intercept \\( b \\) is the point where the line touches the y-axis. It's the starting value of y when no change has occurred (x = 0).\n\n### Examples of Y-Intercept:\n- **Positive Y-Intercept:** \\( y = x + 2 \\) (the line starts at y = 2 when x = 0)\n- **Negative Y-Intercept:** \\( y = x - 1 \\) (the line starts at y = -1 when x = 0)\n- **Zero Y-Intercept:** \\( y = x \\) (the line crosses the y-axis at the origin, y = 0 when x = 0)\n\n## Graphical Representation\nOn a graph, a linear equation results in a straight line. The line's position, steepness, and direction are all determined by the values of \\( m \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n## Applications\nLinear equations are used in various fields:\n- **Economics:** To model relationships between variables like cost and quantity.\n- **Physics:** To describe motion with constant velocity.\n- **Engineering:** To solve problems involving linear systems.\n\n## Solving for Variables\nTo solve a linear equation for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\):\n- **For x:** Rearrange the equation to isolate x. For example, from \\( y = 2x + 3 \\), solving for x gives \\( x = \\frac{y - 3}{2} \\).\n- **For y:** Directly substitute the value of x into the equation to find y.\n\n## Multiple Linear Equations\nWhen dealing with systems of linear equations, methods like substitution or elimination can be used to find solutions where the lines intersect.\n\n@EOF@[Linear Equation, Definition and Structure, Slope, Y-Intercept, Graphical Representation, Applications, Solving for Variables, Multiple Linear Equations]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":450,"completion_tokens":648,"total_tokens":1098,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":450,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
