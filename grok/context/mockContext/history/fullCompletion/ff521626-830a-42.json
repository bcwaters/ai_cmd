The tree splits based on the most significant feature.\n\n2. **First Level Splits**:\n   - **Lot Size**: If the lot size is less than or equal to 5000 square feet, the house falls into the \"Small Lot\" category, otherwise \"Large Lot\".\n   - **Bedrooms**: If the number of bedrooms is less than or equal to 3, the house is categorized as \"Few Beds\", otherwise \"Many Beds\".\n   - **Year Built**: If the house was built on or before 1990, it's \"Older\", otherwise \"Newer\".\n\n3. **Leaf Nodes**: These are the final predictions. Each leaf node represents a predicted home value based on the path taken through the tree.\n\nThis simple tree demonstrates how a Decision Tree Regressor can be used to predict home values by sequentially splitting the dataset on different features until reaching a decision.\n\n@EOF@\n[DecisionTreeRegressor, HomeValuePrediction, LotSize, Bedrooms, YearBuilt, ASCIIArt, MachineLearning, Regression, FeatureSplits, LeafNodes]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":318,"completion_tokens":462,"total_tokens":780,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":318,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
