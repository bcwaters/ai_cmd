Instead, what you see is a collection of Bash variables defining ANSI color codes for use in terminal output. These variables are typically included in scripts or configuration files to enhance the visual output in the terminal. Here's a breakdown of what each \"file\" or section represents:\n\n- **ANSI Color Codes for Mac Terminal**: This is a comment indicating that the following code block is tailored for use in a Mac terminal, though the codes are generally compatible with most modern terminals that support ANSI escape sequences.\n\n- **Standard Colors**: This section defines basic foreground color codes such as `color_green`, `color_red`, etc., and includes a reset code to revert to the terminal's default color.\n\n- **Light Variants**: Here, lighter shades of the standard colors are defined, which are often used for a more vibrant or distinguishable output.\n\n- **Dark Variants**: These are darker shades of the standard colors, using 256-color mode for more precise color control.\n\n- **Background Colors**: This section includes codes for setting background colors in the terminal, from `color_background_green` to `color_background_grok`, offering a range of background color options.\n\nEach of these sections represents a logical grouping of color codes, but they would typically be part of a single script or configuration file rather than separate files.\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n\n- Are you looking to use these color codes in a specific script or project?\n- Do you need help implementing these color codes in a terminal application?\n- Are you interested in learning more about how ANSI escape sequences work in terminals?\n\n@EOF@[ANSI color codes, terminal customization, Mac terminal, Bash scripting, foreground colors, background colors, light colors, dark colors, color reset, 256-color mode]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2030,"completion_tokens":376,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":2406,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2030,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
