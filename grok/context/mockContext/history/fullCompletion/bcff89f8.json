You can do this by using the `ps` command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nps aux | grep node\n```\n\nThis command will list all processes that match the keyword \"node\". The output will look something like this:\n\n```\nuser    12345  0.0  0.1 123456 7890 ?        S    12:34   0:01 /usr/bin/node server.js\n```\n\nThe second column (12345 in this example) is the PID of the Node.js process.\n\n### Step 2: Kill the Process\n\nOnce you have the PID, you can stop the Node.js service using the `kill` command:\n\n```bash\nkill -9 12345\n```\n\nReplace `12345` with the actual PID you found. The `-9` flag sends a SIGKILL signal, which forces the process to terminate immediately.\n\n### Alternative Method: Using `pkill`\n\nIf you prefer a more straightforward approach, you can use `pkill` to stop all Node.js processes:\n\n```bash\npkill node\n```\n\nThis command will send a SIGTERM signal to all processes named \"node\", which should stop them gracefully. If you need to force termination, you can use:\n\n```bash\npkill -9 node\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Find the PID**: Use `ps aux | grep node`.\n- **Kill the Process**: Use `kill -9 PID` or `pkill node`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to stop your Node.js service running in the background.\n\n@EOF@\n[Node.js, background process, kill command, process ID, pkill, terminal commands]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":678,"completion_tokens":415,"total_tokens":1093,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":678,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
