It has a highly elliptical orbit and a thin atmosphere. Pluto's surface is composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices, which give it a reddish hue. Its most significant moon is Charon, which is so large compared to Pluto that they are often considered a binary system. Pluto also has four smaller moons: Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.\n\n### Orbit and Atmosphere\nPluto's orbit is highly elliptical, taking it inside Neptune's orbit at its closest approach to the Sun and far beyond at its farthest. This orbit results in significant seasonal changes. Pluto's thin atmosphere is primarily nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. As Pluto moves away from the Sun, its atmosphere freezes and falls to the surface as ice.\n\n### Surface Features\nThe surface of Pluto is diverse, featuring mountains, valleys, and plains. The most notable feature is the heart-shaped region known as Tombaugh Regio, named after Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh. Within this region, Sputnik Planitia is a vast plain of nitrogen ice. The surface also shows evidence of geological activity, including cryovolcanoes that may erupt water, ammonia, or methane.\n\n### Moons\nCharon, Pluto's largest moon, is about half the size of Pluto and orbits so closely that the two are tidally locked, meaning they always show the same face to each other. Charon's surface is covered with water ice and has a canyon system that stretches for hundreds of miles. The other moons, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra, are much smaller and less well-studied but are believed to be composed primarily of water ice.\n\n### Exploration\nThe New Horizons spacecraft, launched by NASA in 2006, provided the first close-up images and data about Pluto and its moons during its flyby in July 2015. This mission revealed many of the details we know about Pluto today, including its surface features and atmospheric composition.\n\nPluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet came after the discovery of other similar-sized objects in the Kuiper Belt, leading to the establishment of a new category of celestial bodies by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.\n\n@EOF@\n[Pluto, dwarf planet, elliptical orbit, thin atmosphere, nitrogen ice, Charon, binary system, New Horizons, Kuiper Belt, surface features]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":820,"completion_tokens":508,"total_tokens":1328,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":820,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
