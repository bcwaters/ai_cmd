For example, the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = 2x\n$$\n\n#### Integral\nThe integral of a function $f(x)$ represents the area under the curve of $f(x)$. The indefinite integral of $f(x) = x^2$ is:\n$$\n\\int x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n### Physics\n#### Einstein's Equation\nEinstein's famous equation relating mass and energy is:\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\nwhere $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n#### Newton's Second Law\nNewton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n$$\nF = ma\n$$\nwhere $F$ is force, $m$ is mass, and $a$ is acceleration.\n\n@EOF@\n[latex, equations, number theory, algebra, calculus, physics, quadratic equation, pythagorean theorem, derivative, integral, einstein's equation, newton's second law]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":705,"completion_tokens":483,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1188,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":705,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
