This functionality is crucial for maintaining the security and trust of your users.\n\n## How It Works\nCoolify integrates with Let's Encrypt, a free, automated, and open certificate authority, to issue and manage SSL certificates. Here's a detailed look at how this process works:\n\n### Certificate Issuance\n- **Domain Verification**: When you deploy an application, Coolify automatically initiates a domain verification process with Let's Encrypt. This typically involves setting up a temporary HTTP challenge on your server.\n- **Certificate Request**: Once the domain is verified, Coolify requests a certificate from Let's Encrypt. This certificate is then associated with your application's domain.\n\n### Automatic Renewal\n- **Scheduled Checks**: Coolify schedules regular checks to monitor the expiration dates of your SSL certificates. Typically, certificates are renewed 30 days before they expire.\n- **Renewal Process**: If a certificate is nearing its expiration, Coolify automatically initiates a renewal request. This process is seamless and requires no manual intervention from the user.\n\n### Configuration\n- **Nginx Integration**: Coolify uses Nginx as its web server. When a certificate is issued or renewed, Coolify updates the Nginx configuration to use the new certificate, ensuring that your application remains accessible over HTTPS without interruption.\n- **Certificate Storage**: The certificates are stored securely on your server, and Coolify manages their lifecycle, including backups and updates.\n\n## Benefits\n- **Security**: Automatic SSL certificates ensure that your applications are always served over a secure connection, protecting data in transit.\n- **User Trust**: HTTPS is a standard expectation for modern web applications, and automatic SSL certificates help maintain user trust by ensuring your site's security.\n- **Ease of Use**: By automating the entire process, Coolify removes the complexity of managing SSL certificates, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying your applications.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- **Failed Renewals**: If a renewal fails, Coolify will notify you via the dashboard. Common issues include domain validation failures or server misconfigurations. Coolify provides detailed logs to help diagnose and resolve these issues.\n- **Manual Intervention**: In rare cases, manual intervention might be required. Coolify allows you to manually trigger a certificate renewal or update the certificate settings if needed.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Rate Limits**: Let's Encrypt has rate limits on certificate issuance and renewals. Coolify manages these limits internally to ensure compliance, but heavy usage might require additional considerations.\n- **Wildcard Certificates**: Coolify also supports wildcard certificates, which can be useful for managing multiple subdomains under a single certificate.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to configure SSL settings in Coolify, or are you interested in exploring other features?\n\n@EOF@[Automatic SSL Certificates, How It Works, Certificate Issuance, Automatic Renewal, Configuration, Benefits, Troubleshooting, Additional Considerations]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":616,"completion_tokens":601,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1217,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":616,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
