Tokenization involves breaking down text into individual words or tokens.\n\n```regex\n\\b\\w+\\b\n```\nThis regex pattern matches word boundaries (`\\b`) and one or more word characters (`\\w+`), effectively tokenizing text into words.\n\n## 2. **Feature Extraction**\nRegex can help in extracting specific features from text, such as extracting numbers, dates, or specific patterns that are relevant to the machine learning model's features.\n\n```regex\n\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\n```\nThis regex pattern matches IP addresses, which could be a useful feature in certain machine learning applications like network security analysis.\n\n## 3. **Data Cleaning**\nRegex is crucial for cleaning and preprocessing text data, removing unwanted characters, or standardizing text format, which is essential before feeding data into machine learning models.\n\n```regex\n[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]\n```\nThis regex pattern matches any character that is not a letter, number, or whitespace, allowing for the removal of special characters from text data.\n\n@EOF@[Tokenization, Feature Extraction, Data Cleaning]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":514,"completion_tokens":300,"total_tokens":814,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":514,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
