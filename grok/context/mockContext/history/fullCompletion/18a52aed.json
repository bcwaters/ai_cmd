Below are three approaches to achieve this:\n\n#### 1. **Levenshtein Distance with Tokenization**\nThe Levenshtein Distance algorithm measures the difference between two sequences. By tokenizing the strings and applying the Levenshtein Distance, you can compare the similarity between two strings while considering omissions or additions.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom Levenshtein import distance\n\ndef tokenize_and_compare(str1, str2):\n    # Tokenize the strings by splitting on spaces\n    tokens1 = re.findall(r'\\w+', str1.lower())\n    tokens2 = re.findall(r'\\w+', str2.lower())\n    \n    # Remove common words (fluff)\n    fluff = ['the', 'and', 'or', 'but']\n    tokens1 = [token for token in tokens1 if token not in fluff]\n    tokens2 = [token for token in tokens2 if token not in fluff]\n    \n    # Join the tokens back into strings\n    str1_cleaned = ' '.join(tokens1)\n    str2_cleaned = ' '.join(tokens2)\n    \n    # Calculate Levenshtein Distance\n    return distance(str1_cleaned, str2_cleaned)\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nstr2 = \"Quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog\"\nsimilarity = tokenize_and_compare(str1, str2)\nprint(f\"Levenshtein Distance: {similarity}\")\n```\n\n#### 2. **Cosine Similarity with TF-IDF**\nCosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. By using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to weigh the importance of words, you can compare the similarity between two strings while considering the impact of common words.\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\ndef cosine_similarity_tfidf(str1, str2):\n    # Create TF-IDF vectorizer\n    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n    \n    # Fit and transform the strings\n    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([str1, str2])\n    \n    # Calculate cosine similarity\n    similarity = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0:1], tfidf_matrix[1:2])[0][0]\n    \n    return similarity\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nstr2 = \"Quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog\"\nsimilarity = cosine_similarity_tfidf(str1, str2)\nprint(f\"Cosine Similarity: {similarity}\")\n```\n\n#### 3. **Jaro-Winkler Distance with Stop Words Removal**\nThe Jaro-Winkler Distance is another measure of similarity between two strings. By removing stop words (common words that carry less importance), you can improve the accuracy of the comparison.\n\n```python\nimport jellyfish\n\ndef jaro_winkler_with_stop_words_removal(str1, str2):\n    # Define stop words (fluff)\n    stop_words = ['the', 'and', 'or', 'but']\n    \n    # Remove stop words from both strings\n    tokens1 = [word for word in str1.lower().split() if word not in stop_words]\n    tokens2 = [word for word in str2.lower().split() if word not in stop_words]\n    \n    # Join the tokens back into strings\n    str1_cleaned = ' '.join(tokens1)\n    str2_cleaned = ' '.join(tokens2)\n    \n    # Calculate Jaro-Winkler Distance\n    return jellyfish.jaro_winkler(str1_cleaned, str2_cleaned)\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nstr2 = \"Quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog\"\nsimilarity = jaro_winkler_with_stop_words_removal(str1, str2)\nprint(f\"Jaro-Winkler Distance: {similarity}\")\n```\n\nEach of these approaches has its strengths and can be used depending on the specific requirements of your fuzzy search application. \n\n@EOF@\n\n[Levenshtein Distance with Tokenization, Cosine Similarity with TF-IDF, Jaro-Winkler Distance with Stop Words Removal]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":795,"completion_tokens":937,"total_tokens":1732,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":795,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
