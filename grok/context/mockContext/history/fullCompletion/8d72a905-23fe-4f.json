Here is a detailed guide on how to troubleshoot common problems related to LaTeX rendering:\n\n#### Equations Not Rendering\n\n**Symptoms**: \n- Mathematical expressions appear as plain text or are not visible at all.\n\n**Possible Causes**:\n- **MathJax Not Loaded**: If MathJax is not properly included in your HTML or JavaScript files, it won't render the LaTeX expressions.\n- **Incorrect Configuration**: The configuration for MathJax might be incorrect or missing, preventing it from processing the LaTeX code.\n\n**Solutions**:\n- **Check MathJax Inclusion**: Ensure that the MathJax script is correctly included in your HTML. For example:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6\"></script>\n  <script id=\"MathJax-script\" async src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js\"></script>\n  ```\n- **Verify Configuration**: Review your `mathjax-config.js` file to ensure it is correctly set up. For example:\n  ```javascript\n  MathJax = {\n    tex: {\n      inlineMath: [['$', '$'], [\"\\\\(\", \"\\\\)\"]],\n      displayMath: [['$$', '$$'], [\"\\\\[\", \"\\\\]\"]],\n    },\n    svg: {\n      fontCache: 'global'\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n- **Browser Console**: Check the browser's console for any JavaScript errors related to MathJax loading or execution.\n\n#### Syntax Errors\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- LaTeX expressions are partially rendered or appear with error messages.\n\n**Possible Causes**:\n- **Incorrect LaTeX Syntax**: Common mistakes include mismatched brackets, incorrect use of symbols, or using commands that are not supported by your LaTeX environment.\n- **Unsupported Commands**: Some LaTeX commands may not be supported by the rendering engine you are using.\n\n**Solutions**:\n- **Review LaTeX Syntax**: Use a LaTeX editor or an online LaTeX checker to validate your expressions. Common mistakes include:\n  - Mismatched `$` symbols for inline math.\n  - Incorrect use of `\\begin` and `\\end` for environments like matrices.\n  - Missing or extra backslashes (`\\`) for commands.\n- **Check Supported Commands**: Ensure that the LaTeX commands you are using are supported by MathJax. Refer to the MathJax documentation for a list of supported commands.\n- **Use Simplified Expressions**: If possible, simplify your LaTeX expressions to avoid complex commands that may not be universally supported.\n\n#### Performance Issues\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- Slow page load times or delayed rendering of mathematical expressions.\n\n**Possible Causes**:\n- **Heavy LaTeX Content**: Large or complex LaTeX expressions can slow down the rendering process.\n- **Synchronous Loading**: If MathJax is loaded synchronously, it can block the loading of other page elements.\n\n**Solutions**:\n- **Optimize LaTeX Expressions**: Reduce the complexity of your LaTeX expressions where possible. Break down large equations into smaller, more manageable parts.\n- **Asynchronous Loading**: Ensure MathJax is loaded asynchronously to prevent it from blocking the page load. Use the `async` attribute in your script tag:\n  ```html\n  <script id=\"MathJax-script\" async src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js\"></script>\n  ```\n- **Server-Side Rendering**: Consider using server-side rendering to pre-render LaTeX expressions, which can significantly improve initial page load times.\n- **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently used LaTeX expressions to reduce the load on the rendering engine.\n\n#### Additional Tips\n\n- **Logging Errors**: Implement logging in your build process to capture and diagnose errors related to LaTeX rendering. This can help identify issues that are not immediately visible on the frontend.\n- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: If an error occurs during rendering, display a user-friendly message to guide the user on what might have gone wrong and how to fix it.\n- **Regular Updates**: Keep your LaTeX and MathJax libraries up to date to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.\n\nBy following this troubleshooting guide, you can effectively address common issues encountered when rendering LaTeX in your unified pipeline, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience for your users.\n\n@EOF@\n\n[Troubleshooting Guide, Equations Not Rendering, Syntax Errors, Performance Issues, Logging Errors, User-Friendly Error Messages, Regular Updates]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2256,"completion_tokens":897,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":3153,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2256,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
