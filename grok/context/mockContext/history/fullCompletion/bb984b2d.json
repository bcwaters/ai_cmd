They are enclosed in square brackets `[]` and let you specify a group of characters where any single character from the group will satisfy the match. Here's a more detailed look at character classes:\n\n### Basic Character Classes\n\n- **Single Character Match**: Inside square brackets, you can list any number of characters. For example, `[abc]` will match any single occurrence of 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n- **Range of Characters**: You can specify a range of characters using a hyphen. For instance, `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', and `[0-9]` matches any digit from 0 to 9.\n- **Negation**: By placing a caret `^` at the start of the character class, you can match any character that is not listed. For example, `[^abc]` will match any character except 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n\n### Special Character Classes\n\nRegex also provides predefined character classes for common sets of characters:\n\n- **Digits**: `\\d` matches any digit, equivalent to `[0-9]`.\n- **Word Characters**: `\\w` matches any word character (alphanumeric characters plus underscore), equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.\n- **Whitespace**: `\\s` matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks.\n\n### Combining Character Classes with Quantifiers\n\nCharacter classes can be combined with quantifiers to specify how many times a character from the class should appear. For example:\n\n- `[a-z]+` matches one or more lowercase letters.\n- `\\d{3}` matches exactly three digits.\n\n### Use Cases\n\nCharacter classes are incredibly versatile and can be used for a variety of text matching and manipulation tasks:\n\n- **Validation**: Ensuring input strings conform to specific formats, like email addresses or phone numbers.\n- **Data Extraction**: Pulling specific types of data from unstructured text, such as numbers or dates.\n- **Text Cleaning**: Removing or replacing unwanted characters or standardizing text formats.\n\nUnderstanding and effectively using character classes can greatly enhance your ability to perform complex text matching and manipulation tasks with regex.\n\n@EOF@\n[CharacterClasses, regex, textMatching, patternManipulation, validation, dataExtraction, textCleaning, specialCharacterClasses, quantifiers]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":756,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":1256,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":756,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
