This optimization includes resizing, format conversion, and caching, which can significantly improve the load time of your web pages.\n\n## Bypassing Vercel's Image Optimization\n\nIf you want to bypass this optimization for specific images, you can use the `url` parameter directly in your image tags, bypassing Vercel's automatic optimization. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Direct URL Usage**: Instead of using the optimized image URL provided by Vercel, use the direct URL of the image hosted on your server or a CDN.\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"https://your-direct-image-url.com/image.jpg\" alt=\"Description\">\n   ```\n\n2. **Custom Configuration**: You can also configure Vercel to not optimize certain images by modifying the `vercel.json` configuration file.\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"images\": {\n       \"domains\": [\"your-direct-image-url.com\"],\n       \"disableStaticImages\": true\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these methods, you can bypass Vercel's image optimization for specific use cases where you might need full control over the image delivery.\n\n---\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n- Are there specific images you want to bypass optimization for, and why?\n- Have you experienced any issues with Vercel's image optimization that led you to want to bypass it?\n- Are you concerned about the performance impact of bypassing Vercel's image optimization?\n\n@EOF@[Vercel, Image Optimization, Serverless Functions, Bypass Techniques, Performance, Configuration]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":205,"completion_tokens":343,"total_tokens":548,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":205,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
