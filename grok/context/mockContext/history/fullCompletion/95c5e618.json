Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Trimming a Video with FFmpeg\n\nYou can trim a video by specifying the start time and either the duration or the end time. Here are the basic commands:\n\n#### Using Start Time and Duration\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:10 -t 00:00:20 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-ss 00:00:10`: Sets the start time to 10 seconds into the video.\n- `-t 00:00:20`: Sets the duration of the output to 20 seconds.\n- `-c copy`: Copies the codecs without re-encoding, which is faster but might not be precise.\n\n#### Using Start Time and End Time\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:10 -to 00:00:30 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-to 00:00:30`: Sets the end time to 30 seconds into the video.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- If you need more precision, you can remove `-c copy` to re-encode the video, but this will take longer.\n- The `-ss` option can be placed before or after `-i`. Placing it before `-i` is faster but less accurate, while placing it after `-i` is slower but more accurate.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you want to trim a video starting from 1 minute and 30 seconds into the video and lasting for 45 seconds:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:01:30 -t 00:00:45 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will create a new video file `output.mp4` that starts at 1 minute and 30 seconds into the original video and lasts for 45 seconds.\n\n@EOF@\nKEYWORDS\nffmpeg, video trimming, start time, duration, end time, codecs, re-encoding, precision, command line\n@EOF@","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":762,"completion_tokens":478,"total_tokens":1240,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":762,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
