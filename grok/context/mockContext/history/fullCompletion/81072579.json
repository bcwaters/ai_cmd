This conversion can be dangerous if the input Markdown is not trusted or if it contains user-generated content, because it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An XSS attack occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\n\nSanitization needs to be done after the conversion because the Markdown parser does not inherently check for or neutralize potentially harmful scripts. Instead, it focuses on converting Markdown syntax into HTML. Therefore, any `<script>` tags that were part of the original Markdown text are faithfully converted to HTML `<script>` tags, which could then be executed by a web browser.\n\n## Example of Sanitization After Markdown Conversion\n\nConsider the following Markdown text containing a `<script>` tag:\n\n```markdown\nThis is a **bold** text with a harmful script:\n\n<script>alert('XSS attack!');</script>\n```\n\nWhen this Markdown is converted to HTML using `marked`, the output would be:\n\n```html\n<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> text with a harmful script:</p>\n<script>alert('XSS attack!');</script>\n```\n\nIf this HTML were directly rendered in a web browser, the script would execute, showing an alert box. To prevent this, you need to sanitize the HTML after conversion. Using a library like DOMPurify, you can safely clean the HTML:\n\n```javascript\nconst marked = require('marked');\nconst DOMPurify = require('dompurify');\n\n// Convert Markdown to HTML\nconst markdown = 'This is a **bold** text with a harmful script:\\n\\n<script>alert(\\'XSS attack!\\');</script>';\nconst html = marked(markdown);\n\n// Sanitize the HTML\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(html);\n\nconsole.log(clean);\n```\n\nThe output after sanitization would be:\n\n```html\n<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> text with a harmful script:</p>\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `<script>` tag has been removed, preventing any XSS attack.\n\nSanitizing after conversion ensures that any malicious scripts introduced via Markdown are neutralized before the HTML is rendered in a browser, thus protecting users from potential security threats.\n\n@EOF@\n[markdown, HTML conversion, script tags, XSS risk, sanitization, DOMPurify, security, example, safety, web browser]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":450,"completion_tokens":525,"total_tokens":975,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":450,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
