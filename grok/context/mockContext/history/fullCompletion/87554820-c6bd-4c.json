Let's explore the mathematical reasoning behind this phenomenon.\n\n## Mathematical Proof\n\nConsider a set of integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$ where each $a_i$ is divisible by 3. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ a_i = 3k_i \\]\nfor some integer $k_i$.\n\nThe sum of these numbers can be written as:\n\\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_n \\]\nSubstituting the expression for each $a_i$:\n\\[ S = 3k_1 + 3k_2 + 3k_3 + ... + 3k_n \\]\n\nWe can factor out the 3 from the sum:\n\\[ S = 3(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + ... + k_n) \\]\n\nLet \\( T = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + ... + k_n \\), which is an integer. Therefore, the sum \\( S \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ S = 3T \\]\n\nSince \\( S \\) is expressed as \\( 3 \\) times an integer \\( T \\), \\( S \\) is divisible by 3.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proof demonstrates that the sum of any set of numbers divisible by 3 will itself be divisible by 3. This property holds true for any finite set of such numbers and is a fundamental concept in number theory.\n\n@EOF@\n[number theory, divisibility by 3, sum of integers, mathematical proof, integer multiples,]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":365,"completion_tokens":351,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":716,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":365,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
