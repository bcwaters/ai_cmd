This guide assumes you are already familiar with the basics of using remark and unified.js.\n\n## Step 1: Install Necessary Packages\n\nFirst, you need to install the packages that will help you parse and render LaTeX equations in your Markdown documents. Use the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install remark-math rehype-katex\n```\n\n- **remark-math**: This plugin parses LaTeX math equations in Markdown.\n- **rehype-katex**: This plugin renders the parsed LaTeX equations to HTML using KaTeX.\n\n## Step 2: Set Up Your Unified Pipeline\n\nNext, you need to configure your unified pipeline to include the LaTeX parsing and rendering capabilities. Here's a basic setup that includes remark-math and rehype-katex:\n\n```javascript\nconst unified = require('unified')\nconst markdown = require('remark-parse')\nconst remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')\nconst html = require('rehype-stringify')\nconst math = require('remark-math')\nconst katex = require('rehype-katex')\n\nunified()\n  .use(markdown)\n  .use(math)\n  .use(remark2rehype)\n  .use(katex)\n  .use(html)\n  .processSync('Inline math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\\n\\nBlock math:\\n\\n$$ \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$')\n  .toString()\n```\n\nThis pipeline processes a Markdown string that includes inline and block LaTeX equations, converting them into HTML with proper rendering.\n\n## Step 3: Customize LaTeX Rendering (Optional)\n\nIf you need to customize the rendering of LaTeX equations, you can configure `rehype-katex` to use specific KaTeX options. Here's an example of how you might do that:\n\n```javascript\nconst unified = require('unified')\nconst markdown = require('remark-parse')\nconst remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')\nconst html = require('rehype-stringify')\nconst math = require('remark-math')\nconst katex = require('rehype-katex')\n\nunified()\n  .use(markdown)\n  .use(math)\n  .use(remark2rehype)\n  .use(katex, {\n    // KaTeX options\n    throwOnError: false,\n    errorColor: '#cc0000',\n  })\n  .use(html)\n  .processSync('Inline math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$')\n  .toString()\n```\n\nIn this example, we've set `throwOnError` to `false` and specified an `errorColor` for better error handling and visual feedback.\n\n## Step 4: Testing and Validation\n\nAfter setting up your pipeline, it's important to test it with various LaTeX expressions to ensure it works as expected. You can use a variety of equations to check for inline and block math, different types of symbols, and more complex expressions.\n\nHere are a few examples to test:\n\n```markdown\nInline math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\n\nBlock math:\n\n$$ \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$\n\nSummations:\n\n$$ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\n```\n\nRun these through your pipeline and check the output to ensure the LaTeX is rendered correctly.\n\n## Step 5: Integration with Your Project\n\nFinally, integrate this pipeline into your project. This could mean:\n\n- Adding it to a static site generator's build process.\n- Using it within a custom script that processes Markdown files.\n- Incorporating it into a documentation tool that converts Markdown to HTML.\n\nMake sure to document how to use and configure this setup for other team members or users of your project.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively integrate LaTeX parsing into your remark-based Markdown processing pipeline, enhancing your documents with mathematical expressions.\n\n@EOF@[Install Necessary Packages, Set Up Unified Pipeline, Customize LaTeX Rendering, Testing and Validation, Integration with Your Project]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":756,"completion_tokens":860,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1616,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":756,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
