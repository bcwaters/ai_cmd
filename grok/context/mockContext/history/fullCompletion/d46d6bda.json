Let's address them one by one:\n\n### Issue 1: Deprecation Warning\nYou received a deprecation warning about the legacy builder. Docker is moving towards using BuildKit, which is a more modern and efficient way to build Docker images. To resolve this, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install BuildKit**: Follow the instructions at [Docker's Buildx documentation](https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/) to install the buildx component.\n\n2. **Enable BuildKit**: Once installed, enable BuildKit by setting the following environment variable before running your Docker command:\n   ```bash\n   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Buildx**: Instead of `docker build`, use the `docker buildx build` command. Here's how you might modify your command:\n   ```bash\n   docker buildx build -t ai_cmd:test -f ./DockerFile .\n   ```\n\n### Issue 2: Incorrect Path Specification\nThe error message indicates that Docker is trying to use `DockerFile` as a context directory, which is incorrect. The context should be a directory, not a file. Here's how to fix it:\n\n- **Correct Path**: Ensure you're specifying the correct path to the directory containing your Dockerfile. If your Dockerfile is in the current directory, you should use a period (`.`) as the context path.\n\nHere's the corrected command:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t ai_cmd:test -f ./DockerFile .\n```\n\nOr, with BuildKit:\n\n```bash\ndocker buildx build -t ai_cmd:test -f ./DockerFile .\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The `-f` flag specifies the Dockerfile name if it's not the default `Dockerfile`. If your file is named `DockerFile` (note the capital 'F'), you need to specify it with `-f`.\n- Ensure your Dockerfile is named correctly. Docker by default looks for a file named `Dockerfile` (with a lowercase 'f').\n\nTry these adjustments, and let me know if you encounter any further issues.\n\n@EOF@\n[Docker, Dockerfile, build command, BuildKit, buildx, deprecation, troubleshooting, context directory, path specification]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":545,"completion_tokens":469,"total_tokens":1014,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":545,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
