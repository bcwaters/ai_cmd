The error message suggests that an attempt was made to send a file with a status code that is not a valid HTTP status code.\n\n## Correct Status Code for Sending Files\n\nFor sending files successfully, you should use an appropriate HTTP status code. Here are the most common status codes used when sending files:\n\n- **200 OK**: Used when the file is successfully sent and the request is processed correctly.\n- **206 Partial Content**: Used when sending a part of the file, typically in response to a range request.\n\n### Example of Correct Usage\n\nWhen sending a file using Express.js, you should ensure that you're setting a valid status code. Here's an example of how to correctly send a file with Express.js:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/file', (req, res) => {\n  const file = `${__dirname}/path/to/your/file.txt`;\n  res.status(200).sendFile(file);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the status code `200` is explicitly set before calling `sendFile`, ensuring that a valid HTTP status code is used.\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Check the Status Code**: Ensure that you are not passing an invalid status code to `res.status()` or directly to `res.sendFile()`.\n2. **Review Error Handling**: If you're catching errors and trying to send them as a response, make sure you're not accidentally sending the error object as a status code.\n3. **Validate Input**: If the status code is dynamically set based on some conditions, validate that it's always a valid HTTP status code.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the appropriate status codes, you should be able to resolve the `RangeError [ERR_HTTP_INVALID_STATUS_CODE]` when sending files in your Node.js application.\n\n@EOF@\n[HTTP status codes, Node.js, Express.js, file sending, error handling, troubleshooting]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":579,"completion_tokens":442,"total_tokens":1021,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":579,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
