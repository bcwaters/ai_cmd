Here are examples of the concepts discussed:\n\n- **Big O Notation**: The time complexity of an algorithm can be represented as $O(n)$ for linear time, $O(n^2)$ for quadratic time, $O(\\log n)$ for logarithmic time, and $O(n \\log n)$ for linearithmic time.\n\n- **Turing Machines**: The transition function of a Turing machine can be written as $\\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\rightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times \\{L, R\\}$, where $Q$ is the set of states, $\\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, and $L$ and $R$ represent left and right movement of the read/write head.\n\n- **P vs NP Problem**: The P vs NP problem can be stated as $P \\stackrel{?}{=} NP$, where $P$ is the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time and $NP$ is the set of decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.\n\n- **Complexity Classes**: The complexity classes can be represented as $P = \\{L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a deterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \\text{ for some } k\\}$, $NP = \\{L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a nondeterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \\text{ for some } k\\}$, $PSPACE = \\{L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a deterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ uses space } O(n^k) \\text{ for some } k\\}$, and $EXPTIME = \\{L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a deterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ runs in time } O(2^{n^k}) \\text{ for some } k\\}$.\n\n### LaTeX Code Blocks\n\nLaTeX code blocks are used for more complex expressions or when you want to display the LaTeX code itself.
