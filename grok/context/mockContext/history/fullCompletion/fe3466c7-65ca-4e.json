(2017)\n   This paper introduced the Transformer architecture, which has become the foundation for many modern LLMs.\n   [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)\n\n2. **BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding** by Devlin et al. (2018)\n   BERT introduced the concept of bidirectional training of transformers, significantly improving performance on various NLP tasks.\n   [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)\n\n3. **GPT-2: Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners** by Radford et al. (2019)\n   This paper demonstrated the capabilities of large-scale language models in generating coherent text and performing various tasks without specific training.\n   [PDF](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)\n\n4. **Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer** by Raffel et al. (2019)\n   This paper introduced T5, a model that frames all NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem, showing the versatility of transformer models.\n   [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf)\n\n5. **Language Models are Few-Shot Learners** by Brown et al. (2020)\n   This paper introduced GPT-3, showcasing the ability of large language models to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal examples.\n   [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf)\n\nThese papers are crucial for understanding the development and capabilities of modern LLMs.@EOF@[LLM, Transformer, BERT, GPT-2, T5, GPT-3, NLP, AI, Deep Learning, Language Model]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1010,"completion_tokens":436,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1446,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1010,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
