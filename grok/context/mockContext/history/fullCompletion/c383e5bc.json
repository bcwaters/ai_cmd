Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open a Terminal**: Ensure you have access to a terminal or command prompt where Docker is installed.\n\n2. **Use `docker exec`**: You'll use the `docker exec` command to run a command inside a running container. To get an interactive shell inside the container, you can use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID of your container. The `-it` flags allow for an interactive tty (terminal).\n\n3. **Alternative Shells**: If `/bin/bash` is not available in your container, you might need to use another shell like `/bin/sh`:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh\n   ```\n\n4. **Exit the Container**: When you're done, you can exit the container's shell by typing `exit` or using the `Ctrl+D` keyboard shortcut.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to interact with your Docker container as if you were working directly on the system inside the container.\n\n@EOF@\n[docker, container, docker exec, interactive shell, terminal, container ID, /bin/bash, /bin/sh, exit]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":438,"completion_tokens":280,"total_tokens":718,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":438,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
