Pythagorean Theorem\n\n**Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\n**Proof:**\n\nConsider a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$. Construct squares on each of the three sides of the triangle. The area of the square on the hypotenuse is $c^2$. Now, rearrange four copies of the triangle to form a larger square with side length $a + b$. The area of this larger square is $(a + b)^2$. The area of the larger square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares plus the areas of the four triangles. Therefore:\n\\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}ab \\]\n\\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab \\]\nEquating the two expressions for the area of the larger square, we get:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\n### 2. Angle Sum Property of a Triangle\n\n**Theorem:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nConsider a triangle $ABC$. Draw a line parallel to $BC$ through point $A$. Let this line intersect the extensions of $AB$ and $AC$ at points $D$ and $E$, respectively. Since $DE \\parallel BC$, the angles $\\angle DAB$ and $\\angle BCA$ are equal, and the angles $\\angle EAC$ and $\\angle ACB$ are equal. The straight line $DE$ forms a straight angle, which is $180^\\circ$. Therefore:\n\\[ \\angle DAB + \\angle BAC + \\angle EAC = 180^\\circ \\]\nSubstituting the equal angles, we get:\n\\[ \\angle BCA + \\angle BAC + \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ \\]\n\n### 3. Isosceles Triangle Theorem\n\n**Theorem:** If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite those sides are equal.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nConsider an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$. Draw the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, intersecting $BC$ at point $D$. Since $AB = AC$, triangle $ABD$ is congruent to triangle $ACD$ by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) criterion. Therefore, the angles $\\angle ABD$ and $\\angle ACD$ are equal. Since $\\angle ABD$ and $\\angle ACD$ are also the angles opposite sides $AC$ and $AB$, respectively, we have:\n\\[ \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB \\]\n\n### 4. Exterior Angle Theorem\n\n**Theorem:** The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nConsider a triangle $ABC$ with an exterior angle at vertex $C$ formed by extending side $BC$ to point $D$. The exterior angle $\\angle ACD$ is supplementary to the interior angle $\\angle ACB$. Therefore:\n\\[ \\angle ACD = 180^\\circ - \\angle ACB \\]\nThe sum of the interior angles of triangle $ABC$ is $180^\\circ$, so:\n\\[ \\angle BAC + \\angle ABC + \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ \\]\nRearranging, we get:\n\\[ \\angle BAC + \\angle ABC = 180^\\circ - \\angle ACB \\]\nSubstituting this into the expression for the exterior angle, we get:\n\\[ \\angle ACD = \\angle BAC + \\angle ABC \\]\n\n### 5. Midsegment Theorem\n\n**Theorem:** The segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nConsider a triangle $ABC$ with midpoints $D$ and $E$ of sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively. Draw segment $DE$. Since $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $AD = DB$ and $AE = EC$. Draw lines $DF$ and $EG$ parallel to $BC$ through $D$ and $E$, respectively, intersecting at point $F$ on $AB$ extended and point $G$ on $AC$ extended. Since $DF \\parallel BC$ and $EG \\parallel BC$, triangles $ADF$ and $BCE$ are similar to triangle $ABC$. Therefore, $DE$ is parallel to $BC$ and:\n\\[ DE = \\frac{1}{2}BC \\]\n\nThese proofs illustrate the fundamental principles of geometry, showcasing how geometric properties can be rigorously established.\n\n@EOF@\n[geometry, proofs, Pythagorean Theorem, Angle Sum Property, Isosceles Triangle Theorem, Exterior Angle Theorem, Midsegment Theorem, triangles, angles, congruence, similarity,]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":896,"completion_tokens":1083,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1979,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":896,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
