It is divided into two main sub-disciplines: **differential calculus** and **integral calculus**, each serving distinct yet interconnected purposes.\n\n### Differential Calculus\n\nDifferential calculus is primarily concerned with the study of rates of change and slopes of curves. Its key concept is the **derivative**, which measures how a function changes as its input changes. Here's a more detailed look at differential calculus:\n\n- **Derivative**: The derivative of a function at a given point is the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. It is calculated as the limit of the ratio of the change in the function to the change in the input as the change in the input approaches zero.\n  \n  \\[\n  f'(x) = \\lim_{{h \\to 0}} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n  \\]\n\n- **Applications**: Differential calculus is used in various fields such as physics (to determine velocity and acceleration), economics (to optimize profit and cost functions), and engineering (to analyze stress and strain in materials).\n\n### Integral Calculus\n\nIntegral calculus focuses on accumulation and the inverse process of differentiation, known as **integration**. It deals with the area under curves, volumes of solids, and more. Here's a deeper dive into integral calculus:\n\n- **Definite Integral**: The definite integral of a function over an interval calculates the net area between the function and the x-axis from the start to the end of the interval.\n\n  \\[\n  \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n  \\]\n\n- **Indefinite Integral**: The indefinite integral represents a family of functions whose derivative is the integrand. It is essentially the antiderivative of a function plus a constant.\n\n  \\[\n  \\int f(x) \\, dx = F(x) + C\n  \\]\n\n- **Applications**: Integral calculus is essential in physics for calculating work, in engineering for determining quantities like fluid flow, and in economics for calculating total revenue or cost.\n\n### Interconnection between Differential and Integral Calculus\n\nThe **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** bridges the two sub-disciplines by establishing a relationship between differentiation and integration:\n\n- **First Part**: If \\( F \\) is an antiderivative of \\( f \\), then the definite integral of \\( f \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is given by \\( F(b) - F(a) \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n  \\]\n\n- **Second Part**: The derivative of the integral of a function \\( f \\) from a constant \\( a \\) to a variable \\( x \\) is equal to \\( f(x) \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_a^x f(t) \\, dt \\right) = f(x)\n  \\]\n\nThis theorem underscores the deep connection between the two branches, making calculus a coherent and powerful tool for solving complex problems in various scientific and engineering fields.\n\n@EOF@[Calculus, Differential Calculus, Integral Calculus, Derivative, Applications, Definite Integral, Indefinite Integral, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":612,"completion_tokens":640,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1252,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":612,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
