Here's how you can use them:\n\n### Markdown with KaTeX (Using `$` and `$$`)\n\nFor inline math, you use single dollar signs `$...$`. For display math (centered and on its own line), you use double dollar signs `$$...$$`.\n\n#### Inline Math\n```markdown\nThe quadratic formula is given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n```\n\n#### Display Math\n```markdown\nThe Pythagorean theorem can be written as:\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n```\n\n### Plain LaTeX (Using `\\( ... \\)` and `\\[ ... \\]`) \n\nIn plain LaTeX, inline math is denoted by `\\( ... \\)`, and display math is denoted by `\\[ ... \\]`.\n\n#### Inline Math\n```latex\nThe quadratic formula is given by \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n```\n\n#### Display Math\n```latex\nThe Pythagorean theorem can be written as:\n\\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\]\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Markdown with KaTeX**: This is typically used in web-based Markdown editors or in systems where Markdown is rendered into HTML with math support.\n- **Plain LaTeX**: This is used in LaTeX documents, which are typically compiled into PDF or other formats.\n\nBoth methods support the same LaTeX syntax for writing equations but use different delimiters to indicate where the math starts and ends.\n\n@EOF@\nmarkdown, katex, latex, math, inline, display, delimiters, quadratic, pythagorean","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":595,"completion_tokens":351,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":946,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":595,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
