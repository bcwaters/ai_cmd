This is a common operation in image processing and computer vision, where a mask can be used to selectively modify parts of an image.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to apply a mask to an image using TensorFlow.js:\n\n1. **Setup**: First, you need to include TensorFlow.js in your project. You can do this by adding the following script tag to your HTML file:\n\n    ```html\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest\"></script>\n    ```\n\n2. **Load Image**: Load the image you want to process. For simplicity, we'll assume you have a canvas element where the image is already drawn.\n\n3. **Create Mask**: Create a mask tensor. This can be a binary mask (0s and 1s) where 1 indicates the area to be modified.\n\n4. **Apply Mask**: Multiply the image tensor with the mask tensor to apply the mask.\n\nHere is a JavaScript code snippet to perform this operation:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming 'imageTensor' is a 3D tensor representing the image\n// and 'maskTensor' is a 2D tensor representing the mask\n\n// Convert image tensor to float if necessary\nconst floatImageTensor = tf.cast(imageTensor, 'float32');\n\n// Expand the mask to match the image's dimensions\nconst expandedMask = maskTensor.expandDims(2).tile([1, 1, 3]);\n\n// Apply the mask\nconst maskedImage = floatImageTensor.mul(expandedMask);\n\n// Optionally, you can add another tensor to the masked areas\nconst additionalTensor = tf.zerosLike(floatImageTensor);\nconst result = maskedImage.add(additionalTensor.mul(expandedMask.logicalNot()));\n\n// Convert back to uint8 if necessary\nconst uint8Result = tf.cast(result, 'int32');\n\n// Display or further process the result\nuint8Result.data().then(data => {\n    // Handle the data as needed, e.g., draw to a canvas\n});\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to apply a mask to an image using TensorFlow.js, allowing you to selectively modify parts of the image based on the mask provided.\n\n@EOF@\n[TensorFlow.js, ImageProcessing, MaskApplication, JavaScript, WebDevelopment, BrowserML, TensorManipulation]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":274,"completion_tokens":492,"total_tokens":766,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":274,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
