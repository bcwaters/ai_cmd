There are primarily two types of non-Euclidean geometry:\n\n1. **Hyperbolic Geometry**: In this type, the parallel postulate is replaced with the statement that through any point not on a given line, there are at least two distinct lines that do not intersect the given line. This results in a space that can be visualized as a saddle shape.\n\n2. **Elliptic Geometry**: Here, the parallel postulate is replaced by the statement that through any point not on a given line, there are no lines that do not intersect the given line. This leads to a space that can be visualized on the surface of a sphere.\n\nNon-Euclidean geometries have significant implications in various fields, including physics (especially in the theory of general relativity) and computer graphics.\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n- What are some practical applications of non-Euclidean geometry?\n- How does non-Euclidean geometry differ from Euclidean geometry in terms of axioms?\n- Can you explain the role of non-Euclidean geometry in Einstein's theory of general relativity?\n\n@EOF@[Non-Euclidean Geometry, Hyperbolic Geometry, Elliptic Geometry, Applications, Axioms, General Relativity]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":298,"completion_tokens":266,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":564,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":298,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
