Here is how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nls -l --time=creation --sort=time\n```\n\nThis command will list the files in the current directory sorted by creation time. Note that the `--time=creation` option might not be supported on all systems. If your system does not support it, you can use the following alternative:\n\n```bash\nstat -c \"%w %n\" * | sort -n\n```\n\nThis command uses `stat` to get the creation time (`%w`) and filename (`%n`), then pipes the output to `sort` to sort numerically by the timestamp.\n\nIf you want to see the output in a more traditional `ls -l` format, you can combine `ls` with `stat` and `sort`:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *; do\n  echo \"$(stat -c \"%w\" \"$f\") $f\"\ndone | sort -n | while read -r line; do\n  file=$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d' ' -f2-)\n  ls -ld \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nThis script will list the files in a long format (`-l`) sorted by creation time.\n\n@EOF@\n[bash, ls, sort, creation time, stat, command line, file management]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":456,"completion_tokens":295,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":751,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":456,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
