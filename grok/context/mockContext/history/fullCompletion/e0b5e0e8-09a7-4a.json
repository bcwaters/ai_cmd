You can specify the Python version you want to use:\n   ```bash\n   uv venv create --python=3.9 myenv\n   ```\n   This command creates a new virtual environment named `myenv` using Python 3.9.\n\n3. **Activate the Environment**:\n   - On Unix or MacOS:\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n4. **Install Packages**:\n   Once the environment is activated, you can install packages using `uv`:\n   ```bash\n   uv pip install package_name\n   ```\n\n5. **Deactivate the Environment**:\n   When you're done, deactivate the environment:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   ```\n\nUsing `uv` provides faster installation and dependency resolution compared to traditional tools like `pip` and `virtualenv`.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more detailed assistance, please let me know!\n\n@EOF@\n[uv, Python, environment, virtual environment, installation, package management, pip, activate, deactivate]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":293,"completion_tokens":297,"total_tokens":590,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":293,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
