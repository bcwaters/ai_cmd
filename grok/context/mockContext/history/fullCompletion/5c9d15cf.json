The basic syntax is as follows:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t <image-name>:<tag> <path-to-dockerfile>\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `-t` specifies the name and optionally a tag in the `name:tag` format for the resulting image.\n- `<image-name>` is the name you want to give your Docker image.\n- `<tag>` is an optional tag, which defaults to `latest` if not specified.\n- `<path-to-dockerfile>` is the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile. If the Dockerfile is in the current directory, you can use `.`.\n\n### Example\n\nIf your Dockerfile is in the current directory and you want to name the image `myapp` with the tag `v1.0`, you would run:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t myapp:v1.0 .\n```\n\nThis command builds the Docker image based on the instructions in your Dockerfile and tags it as `myapp:v1.0`.\n\n@EOF@\n[Docker, Dockerfile, build command, image tagging, syntax, example]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":460,"completion_tokens":243,"total_tokens":703,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":460,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
