Email Validation\n\n**Regex Pattern:**\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis regex pattern is used to validate email addresses. It ensures that the string contains:\n- One or more characters for the username part (before the `@`), which can include letters, numbers, and certain special characters (`._%+-`).\n- An `@` symbol separating the username from the domain.\n- One or more characters for the domain part, which can include letters, numbers, and dots (`.`).\n- A dot (`.`) followed by the top-level domain, which must be at least two characters long.\n\n**Use Case:**\nTo check if an input string is a valid email address.\n\n### 2. Password Strength\n\n**Regex Pattern:**\n```regex\n^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])[A-Za-z\\d!@#$%^&*]{8,}$\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis regex pattern is designed to check for password strength. It ensures that the password:\n- Contains at least one lowercase letter (`[a-z]`).\n- Contains at least one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`).\n- Contains at least one digit (`\\d`).\n- Contains at least one special character from the set `!@#$%^&*`.\n- Is at least 8 characters long.\n\n**Use Case:**\nTo enforce a strong password policy, ensuring the password meets complexity requirements.\n\n### 3. URL Validation\n\n**Regex Pattern:**\n```regex\n^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis regex pattern is used to validate URLs. It checks for:\n- An optional `http://` or `https://` at the beginning.\n- A domain name composed of letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.\n- A top-level domain (TLD) of 2 to 6 characters.\n- An optional path after the domain, which can include letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, and slashes.\n\n**Use Case:**\nTo validate whether an input string is a properly formatted URL.\n\nThese regex patterns can be used in various programming languages and tools to ensure that strings meet specific formatting criteria.\n\n@EOF@[Email Validation, Password Strength, URL Validation]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":514,"completion_tokens":529,"total_tokens":1043,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":514,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
