Here's a detailed guide on how to integrate this pipeline into different types of projects:\n\n#### Static Site Generators\n\nStatic site generators like Gatsby, Next.js, or Hugo are popular platforms for building fast and efficient websites. Here’s how you can integrate the LaTeX parsing pipeline into a Gatsby project:\n\n1. **Gatsby Configuration:**\n   In your `gatsby-config.js` file, you'll need to configure the `gatsby-transformer-remark` plugin to use your custom LaTeX parsing pipeline. Here's an example configuration:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // gatsby-config.js\n   module.exports = {\n     plugins: [\n       {\n         resolve: 'gatsby-transformer-remark',\n         options: {\n           plugins: [\n             {\n               resolve: 'gatsby-remark-custom-plugin',\n               options: {\n                 processors: [\n                   require('remark-parse'),\n                   require('remark-math'),\n                   require('remark-rehype'),\n                   require('rehype-katex', { throwOnError: false, errorColor: '#cc0000' }),\n                   require('rehype-stringify'),\n                 ],\n               },\n             },\n           ],\n         },\n       },\n     ],\n   };\n   ```\n\n   This configuration tells Gatsby to process Markdown files using your custom pipeline, which includes the LaTeX parsing capability.\n\n2. **Testing and Validation:**\n   After setting up the configuration, you should test your site to ensure that LaTeX expressions are rendered correctly. You can do this by creating a test Markdown file with various LaTeX expressions and checking the rendered output on your local development server.\n\n3. **Deployment Considerations:**\n   When deploying your Gatsby site, ensure that the necessary dependencies are included in your `package.json` file. Also, verify that your hosting environment supports the rendering of KaTeX, as some hosts might have specific requirements or limitations.\n\n#### Custom Scripts\n\nIf you're working with custom scripts outside of a static site generator, you can still integrate the LaTeX parsing pipeline. Here’s how:\n\n1. **Script Integration:**\n   You can create a standalone script that processes Markdown files with LaTeX expressions. Here’s an example of how you might structure such a script:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const fs = require('fs');\n   const path = require('path');\n   const unified = require('unified');\n   const remarkParse = require('remark-parse');\n   const remarkMath = require('remark-math');\n   const remarkRehype = require('remark-rehype');\n   const rehypeKatex = require('rehype-katex');\n   const rehypeStringify = require('rehype-stringify');\n\n   const processMarkdownFile = (inputPath, outputPath) => {\n     const markdownContent = fs.readFileSync(inputPath, 'utf8');\n     const htmlOutput = unified()\n       .use(remarkParse)\n       .use(remarkMath)\n       .use(remarkRehype)\n       .use(rehypeKatex, { throwOnError: false, errorColor: '#cc0000' })\n       .use(rehypeStringify)\n       .processSync(markdownContent)\n       .toString();\n\n     fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, htmlOutput);\n   };\n\n   // Example usage\n   const inputFile = path.join(__dirname, 'input.md');\n   const outputFile = path.join(__dirname, 'output.html');\n   processMarkdownFile(inputFile, outputFile);\n   ```\n\n   This script reads a Markdown file, processes it through the LaTeX parsing pipeline, and writes the resulting HTML to an output file.\n\n2. **Automation and Build Processes:**\n   To automate this process, you can integrate the script into your build process. For example, you might use a task runner like Gulp or a build tool like Webpack to run the script as part of your build workflow.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Logging:**\n   Make sure to implement proper error handling and logging within your script to help diagnose any issues that arise during the processing of Markdown files.\n\n#### Documentation Tools\n\nIf you're using documentation tools like Docusaurus or VuePress, you can also integrate the LaTeX parsing pipeline:\n\n1. **Docusaurus Configuration:**\n   For Docusaurus, you can extend the `remarkPlugins` and `rehypePlugins` in your `docusaurus.config.js` file:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // docusaurus.config.js\n   module.exports = {\n     presets: [\n       [\n         '@docusaurus/preset-classic',\n         {\n           docs: {\n             remarkPlugins: [require('remark-math')],\n             rehypePlugins: [\n               [require('rehype-katex'), { throwOnError: false, errorColor: '#cc0000' }],\n             ],\n           },\n         },\n       ],\n     ],\n   };\n   ```\n\n   This configuration ensures that LaTeX expressions are processed and rendered correctly within your Docusaurus documentation.\n\n2. **VuePress Configuration:**\n   For VuePress, you can modify the `markdown` configuration in your `config.js` file:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // config.js\n   module.exports = {\n     markdown: {\n       extendMarkdown: (md) => {\n         md.use(require('remark-math'))\n           .use(require('remark-rehype'))\n           .use(require('rehype-katex'), { throwOnError: false, errorColor: '#cc0000' })\n           .use(require('rehype-stringify'));\n       },\n     },\n   };\n   ```\n\n   This setup enables VuePress to process Markdown files with LaTeX expressions using the unified pipeline.\n\nBy integrating the LaTeX parsing pipeline into your project in this manner, you can ensure that your documentation and content can include complex mathematical expressions rendered beautifully and accurately.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2791,"completion_tokens":1184,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":3975,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2791,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
