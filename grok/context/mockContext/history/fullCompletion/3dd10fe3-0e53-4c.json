The general form of a quadratic equation is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. In this case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = 4 \\).\n\n#### Components\n\n- **Coefficient \\( a \\)**: This determines the direction and width of the parabola. Since \\( a = 1 \\) (positive), the parabola opens upwards.\n- **Coefficient \\( b \\)**: Affects the position of the parabola along the x-axis.\n- **Coefficient \\( c \\)**: The y-intercept of the parabola, where the graph crosses the y-axis.\n\n### Solving\n\nThe equation \\( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \\) can be solved using various methods:\n\n#### Factoring\n\nThe quadratic can be factored as:\n\\[\ny = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\nThis indicates that the equation has a double root at \\( x = 2 \\). The factorization shows that the parabola touches the x-axis at only one point, known as a vertex.\n\n#### Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) can be applied:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 0}{2} = 2\n\\]\nThis confirms the root at \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n#### Completing the Square\n\nTo complete the square:\n\\[\ny = x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x^2 - 4x + 4) = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\nThis method also results in \\( (x - 2)^2 \\), verifying the vertex form of the equation.\n\n### Graphical Representation\n\nThe graph of \\( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \\) is a parabola with:\n- **Vertex**: At \\( (2, 0) \\). This is the lowest (or highest) point of the parabola.\n- **Axis of Symmetry**: The vertical line \\( x = 2 \\).\n- **Intercepts**: The parabola touches the x-axis at \\( x = 2 \\) and the y-axis at \\( y = 4 \\).\n\n### Examples\n\n- **Example 1**: If \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 0^2 - 4 \\cdot 0 + 4 = 4 \\). The point \\( (0, 4) \\) lies on the parabola.\n- **Example 2**: If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( y = 2^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 + 4 = 0 \\). The point \\( (2, 0) \\) is the vertex and the only x-intercept.\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nQuadratic equations are used in various fields:\n\n- **Physics**: Describing the path of a projectile under gravity.\n- **Engineering**: Designing parabolic shapes for satellite dishes or bridges.\n- **Economics**: Modeling profit functions where revenue and cost are quadratic.\n- **Biology**: Analyzing population growth models.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe quadratic equation \\( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \\) is a perfect square trinomial, which simplifies to \\( (x - 2)^2 \\). It represents a parabola that opens upwards with a vertex at \\( (2, 0) \\). The equation is significant in multiple disciplines for modeling and solving problems involving quadratic relationships.\n\n@EOF@[Quadratic Equation, Components, Solving, Factoring, Quadratic Formula, Completing the Square, Graphical Representation, Examples, Real-World Applications, Summary]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":538,"completion_tokens":859,"total_tokens":1397,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":538,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
