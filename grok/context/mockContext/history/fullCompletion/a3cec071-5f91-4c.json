Here's how some common complexities are represented in LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{align*}\nO(n) & \\text{ represents linear time complexity} \\\\\nO(n^2) & \\text{ represents quadratic time complexity} \\\\\nO(\\log n) & \\text{ represents logarithmic time complexity} \\\\\nO(n \\log n) & \\text{ represents linearithmic time complexity}\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n### Turing Machines\n\nA Turing machine is a theoretical computing machine that serves as a model for modern computers. The transition function of a Turing machine can be represented as:\n\n```latex\n\\delta : Q \\times \\Gamma \\rightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times \\{L, R\\}\n```\n\nwhere $Q$ is the set of states, $\\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, and $L$ and $R$ represent left and right movement of the read/write head.\n\n### P vs NP Problem\n\nThe P vs NP problem is one of the most important open problems in theoretical computer science. It can be stated as:\n\nIs $P = NP$? Where $P$ is the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time, and $NP$ is the set of decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.\n\nIn LaTeX, this can be written inline as: $P \\stackrel{?}{=} NP$.\n\n### Complexity Classes\n\nComplexity classes are sets of problems grouped by their resource requirements. Some common complexity classes include:\n\n- $P$: Problems solvable in polynomial time\n- $NP$: Problems verifiable in polynomial time\n- $PSPACE$: Problems solvable in polynomial space\n- $EXPTIME$: Problems solvable in exponential time\n\nThese can be represented in a LaTeX code block as:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{align*}\nP & = \\{ L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a deterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \\text{ for some } k \\} \\\\\nNP & = \\{ L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a nondeterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \\text{ for some } k \\} \\\\\nPSPACE & = \\{ L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a deterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ uses space } O(n^k) \\text{ for some } k \\} \\\\\nEXPTIME & = \\{ L \\mid \\exists \\text{ a deterministic TM } M \\text{ such that } L(M) = L \\text{ and } M \\text{ runs in time } O(2^{n^k}) \\text{ for some } k \\}\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\nThis mix of inline and code block LaTeX should give you a good overview of how theoretical computer science concepts can be represented using mathematical notation.@EOF@[LaTeX, Big O Notation, Turing Machines, P vs NP, Complexity Classes, Theoretical Computer Science, Polynomial Time, Nondeterministic, Space Complexity, Exponential Time]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":721,"completion_tokens":689,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1410,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":721,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
