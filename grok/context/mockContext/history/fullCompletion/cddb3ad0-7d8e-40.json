Its proof can be visualized through many different methods, making it a favorite in mathematics education.\n\n## 2. **The Inscribed Angle Theorem**\n\n**Statement:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.\n\n**Mathematical Expression:** If an inscribed angle \\( \\angle ABC \\) intercepts arc \\( \\stackrel{\\frown}{AC} \\) on a circle, then:\n\\[ \\angle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{arc} \\, \\stackrel{\\frown}{AC} \\]\n\n**Coolness Factor:** This theorem elegantly connects the properties of circles and angles, allowing for the calculation of angles and arcs with ease. It's particularly cool because it simplifies complex geometric problems and has applications in fields like astronomy for calculating celestial angles.\n\n@EOF@\ngeometry, theorems, PythagoreanTheorem, InscribedAngleTheorem, righttriangle, hypotenuse, circle, arc, angles","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1137,"completion_tokens":323,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1460,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1137,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
