They are indexed collections of data, where each item can be accessed by its index, starting from 0. Arrays are versatile and can hold any type of data, including other arrays, objects, and primitive values. They have built-in methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, and `splice()` for manipulating their elements.\n\n### 2. **Objects**\nObjects are key-value pair collections in JavaScript, similar to dictionaries or maps in other languages. They are used to store data in a structured way, allowing you to access values using their corresponding keys. Objects can contain functions (methods), making them useful for creating complex data structures. They are mutable and can be easily extended or modified.\n\n### 3. **Maps**\nMaps are part of the ES6 standard and provide a way to store key-value pairs where any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value. Unlike objects, Maps maintain insertion order of the keys and are iterable. They also offer useful methods like `set()`, `get()`, `has()`, `delete()`, and `clear()`.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to use these data structures in practice? Here are a few follow-up questions you might consider:\n\n- Can you provide examples of how to use Arrays in real-world JavaScript applications?\n- How do Objects help in organizing data in JavaScript, and what are some common use cases?\n- What are the advantages of using Maps over Objects in JavaScript, and when should I use them?\n\n@EOF@[Arrays, Objects, Maps]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":297,"completion_tokens":345,"total_tokens":642,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":297,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
