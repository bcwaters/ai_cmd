Here's a more detailed look into its characteristics, based on the information provided earlier:\n\n### Orbital Characteristics\nNeptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers, taking approximately 165 Earth years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is nearly circular, but it's notable for its interactions with Pluto, whose orbit can bring it inside Neptune's at certain points. This interaction, however, does not result in a collision due to the 2:3 orbital resonance between the two bodies, meaning Pluto orbits the Sun twice for every three orbits of Neptune.\n\n### Atmosphere\nNeptune's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane. The methane in the upper atmosphere absorbs red light, giving Neptune its striking blue color. The atmosphere is also known for its dynamic weather patterns, including the fastest winds in the solar system, which can reach speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. One of the most notable features is the Great Dark Spot, a large storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, observed during the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989.\n\n### Internal Structure\nBeneath its thick atmosphere, Neptune is believed to have a mantle of water, ammonia, and other ices, surrounding a small, rocky core. The planet's internal heat source is significant, leading to the intense atmospheric activity observed on its surface.\n\n### Moons and Rings\nNeptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming in place. Triton also has geysers that spew nitrogen gas and dust particles, making it one of the most geologically active bodies in our solar system. In addition to its moons, Neptune has a faint ring system, discovered in 1984, composed of dust particles and small rocks.\n\n### Exploration\nNeptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989. This mission provided invaluable data about Neptune's atmosphere, moons, and rings. Future missions to Neptune are being considered, but none are currently planned, leaving much of the planet's mysteries yet to be explored.\n\nNeptune's unique features and its position as the outermost gas giant in our solar system make it a subject of continuous interest and study in the field of planetary science.\n\n@EOF@\n[Neptune, solar system, blue planet, orbital resonance, Pluto, atmosphere, hydrogen, helium, methane, fast winds, Great Dark Spot, internal structure, mantle, rocky core, moons, Triton, retrograde orbit, geysers, rings, Voyager 2, exploration, future missions]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":840,"completion_tokens":595,"total_tokens":1435,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":840,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
