For instance, the time complexity of an algorithm can be expressed using Big O notation, which gives an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's runtime. In LaTeX, this can be written as $O(n^2)$ for an algorithm with quadratic time complexity.\n\nAnother important concept is the Turing machine, a theoretical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. The transition function of a Turing machine can be represented in LaTeX as $\\delta(q, a) = (q', a', D)$, where $q$ and $q'$ are states, $a$ and $a'$ are symbols, and $D$ is the direction of movement.\n\nIn the study of decidability, the halting problem is famously undecidable. This can be expressed in LaTeX as: Given a program $P$ and input $I$, it is impossible to determine in general whether $P$ will halt on $I$, symbolized as $\\text{Halt}(P, I)$.\n\nLastly, in the context of automata theory, a regular expression for a language that accepts strings of $a$'s and $b$'s where the number of $a$'s is even can be written as $(ab^*a)^*b^*$ in LaTeX.@EOF@[computational theory, LaTeX syntax, Big O notation, Turing machine, halting problem, automata theory, regular expressions]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":474,"completion_tokens":297,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":771,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":474,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
