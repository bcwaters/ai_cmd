Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ncommand1 arg1 arg2 arg3; command2 argA argB argC\n```\n\nIn this format:\n- `command1` is the first shell command with its arguments `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3`.\n- `;` is used to separate the commands, indicating that the second command should run after the first one completes.\n- `command2` is the second shell command with its arguments `argA`, `argB`, and `argC`.\n\nFor example, if you want to list files with detailed information and in reverse chronological order, and then search for a pattern in multiple files, it would look like this:\n\n```bash\nls -l -r; grep pattern file1.txt file2.txt\n```\n\nThis format allows you to clearly show multiple commands and their respective arguments, making it easy to understand and replicate in a shell environment.\n\n@EOF@\n[shell command, multiple arguments, sequential commands, bash syntax, example usage]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":467,"completion_tokens":227,"total_tokens":694,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":467,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
