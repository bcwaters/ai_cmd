Here's how it's represented in LaTeX: $\\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^k e^{z_j}}$. In this equation, $z_i$ represents the input to the output layer for the $i$th class, $k$ is the total number of classes, and the denominator is the sum of the exponentials of all inputs.\n\n**Trigonometric Identities**\n\nTrigonometry is fundamental in mathematics and physics. Let's look at some common trigonometric identities in LaTeX: $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$. This is the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions. Another identity is $\\sin(a+b) = \\sin a \\cos b + \\cos a \\sin b$, which is the angle addition formula for sine. The tangent function is defined as $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$.\n\n**Order Notation**\n\nOrder notation, particularly big O notation, is crucial in algorithm analysis and computer science. Here are some examples in LaTeX: $O(n)$ represents linear time complexity, $O(n^2)$ represents quadratic time complexity, $O(\\log n)$ represents logarithmic time complexity, and $O(n \\log n)$ represents linearithmic time complexity. These notations describe the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or space requirements relative to the input size.\n\n**Combining Concepts**\n\nLet's combine these concepts in a more complex example: Let $f(n) = O(n^2)$ be the time complexity of an algorithm that uses softmax activation. The softmax function for the output layer is given by $\\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^k e^{z_j}}$. If we apply this to a trigonometric function, we get $\\text{softmax}(\\sin \\theta) = \\frac{e^{\\sin \\theta}}{\\sum_{j=1}^k e^{\\sin \\theta_j}}$.\n\nThese LaTeX examples showcase the power of mathematical notation in representing complex concepts from various fields of study. By using LaTeX, we can create precise and visually appealing representations of mathematical ideas, making them easier to understand and communicate.@EOF@KEYWORDS: LaTeX, softmax, trigonometry, order notation, big O, machine learning, algorithm analysis, mathematical notation","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":805,"completion_tokens":537,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1342,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":805,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
