It is primarily used for creating type-safe APIs that can be easily integrated into full-stack TypeScript applications. Here's a brief overview of tRPC:\n\n- **Type Safety**: tRPC leverages TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety across the client and server, reducing runtime errors.\n- **Simplified API Development**: It abstracts away much of the complexity involved in setting up and managing API endpoints, allowing developers to focus on business logic.\n- **Integration**: tRPC is particularly well-suited for use with Next.js and other modern web frameworks, enhancing the development experience by integrating seamlessly with existing TypeScript ecosystems.\n- **Performance**: By using WebSocket or HTTP, tRPC can provide real-time communication and efficient data transfer between client and server.\n\nFor a basic example of how tRPC might be used in a project, consider the following:\n\n```typescript\n// server.ts\nimport * as trpc from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n\nconst appRouter = trpc.router().query('hello', {\n  input: z.string().nullish(),\n  resolve({ input }) {\n    return `Hello ${input ?? 'World'}`;\n  },\n});\n\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\n\n// client.ts\nimport { createTRPCProxyClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport type { AppRouter } from './server';\n\nconst client = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [httpBatchLink({ url: 'http://localhost:3000/trpc' })],\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const result = await client.hello.query('Alice');\n  console.log(result); // Output: Hello Alice\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple query setup with tRPC, showing how to define a server endpoint and consume it from a client.\n\n@EOF@[tRPC, TypeScript, RPC, API, type-safety, Next.js, WebSocket, HTTP, full-stack, development, performance]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":271,"completion_tokens":430,"total_tokens":701,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":271,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
