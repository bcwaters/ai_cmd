Hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Check Current Remote URL\n\nFirst, verify the current remote URL of your repository using the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nThis command will list all the remote repositories configured for your local repository, showing both fetch and push URLs.\n\n### Step 2: Update the Remote URL\n\nTo update the URL, you can use the `git remote set-url` command. There are two common scenarios:\n\n#### Scenario 1: Changing from HTTPS to SSH or vice versa\n\nIf you are switching between HTTPS and SSH, you can use:\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin <new-url>\n```\n\nReplace `<new-url>` with your new repository URL. For example:\n\n- For HTTPS: `https://github.com/username/repository.git`\n- For SSH: `git@github.com:username/repository.git`\n\n#### Scenario 2: Renaming the Repository or Changing the Account\n\nIf you are renaming the repository or moving it to a different account, you'll need to update both the fetch and push URLs:\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:newusername/newrepository.git\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Change\n\nAfter updating the URL, verify the change using:\n\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nThis should now show the new URL for both fetch and push operations.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **HTTPS vs. SSH**: If you switch from HTTPS to SSH, make sure you have an SSH key set up with GitHub.\n- **Multiple Remotes**: If your repository has multiple remotes, ensure you update the correct one (commonly `origin`).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully update your GitHub repository URL.\n\n@EOF@\n[GitHub, repository, URL, update, remote, HTTPS, SSH, git, terminal, fetch, push]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":699,"completion_tokens":413,"total_tokens":1112,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":699,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
