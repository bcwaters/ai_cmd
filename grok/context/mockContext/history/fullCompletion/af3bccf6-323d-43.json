The same principle applies to other languages like Python, HTML, CSS, etc., by replacing `javascript` with the appropriate language identifier.\n\n@EOF@\n[Markdown, syntax highlighting, code blocks, language declaration]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":281,"completion_tokens":141,"total_tokens":422,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":281,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
