In this formula:\n- \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent the lengths of the two legs of the triangle.\n- \\(c\\) represents the length of the hypotenuse, which is the side opposite the right angle.\n\nTo render this equation, you would use tools like KaTeX or MathJax after processing the Markdown with plugins such as `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`. This process involves identifying and isolating the LaTeX within the Markdown, followed by rendering it into HTML and CSS for display.\n\n@EOF@\n[LaTeX, Pythagorean theorem, KaTeX, MathJax, remark-math, rehype-katex, rendering, Markdown, HTML, CSS]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":487,"completion_tokens":191,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":678,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":487,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
