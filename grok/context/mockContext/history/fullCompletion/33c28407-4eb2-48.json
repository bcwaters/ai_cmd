Fourier Transform\n\nThe Fourier Transform converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. The equation for the continuous Fourier Transform is:\n\n\\[ X(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-j2\\pi ft} \\, dt \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X(f) \\) is the Fourier Transform of the signal \\( x(t) \\)\n- \\( t \\) is time\n- \\( f \\) is frequency\n- \\( j \\) is the imaginary unit\n\n### 2. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\n\nFor digital signals, the Discrete Fourier Transform is used. The equation for the DFT is:\n\n\\[ X(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X(k) \\) is the \\( k \\)-th element of the DFT of \\( x(n) \\)\n- \\( N \\) is the number of samples\n- \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) are integers ranging from 0 to \\( N-1 \\)\n\n### 3. Convolution\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operation used to express the output of a linear time-invariant system. The convolution of two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ (f * g)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau) \\, d\\tau \\]\n\nIn the discrete case, it becomes:\n\n\\[ (f * g)[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f[m] g[n-m] \\]\n\nThese equations are essential for various signal processing applications, enabling the analysis and manipulation of signals in both time and frequency domains.\n\n@EOF@\nsignal processing, Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, Convolution, time domain, frequency domain, linear systems","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":692,"completion_tokens":382,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1074,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":692,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
