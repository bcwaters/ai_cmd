By capturing the rendered output of a component and comparing it against a reference snapshot, developers can easily detect unintended changes. This method is efficient for UI testing, integrates well with version control, and allows for customization of what gets included in the snapshot.\n\n### 2. **Unit Testing with Mocks**\nJest supports unit testing by allowing developers to use mock functions and modules. This principle is crucial for isolating the component or function being tested, enabling the simulation of return values, errors, and the mocking of entire modules. This approach enhances test isolation and makes it easier to test business logic without dependencies on external systems.\n\n@EOF@[Snapshot Testing, Unit Testing with Mocks]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1048,"completion_tokens":164,"total_tokens":1212,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1048,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
