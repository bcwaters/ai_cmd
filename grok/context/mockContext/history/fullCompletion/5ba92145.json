However, for practical deployment in web browsers, models are often optimized to be as small as possible while maintaining acceptable performance. \n\n- **Typical Size Range**: After applying techniques like quantization and pruning, a typical image recognition model suitable for browser deployment might range from **5 MB to 20 MB**. This size allows for efficient loading and inference within the constraints of web environments.\n\n### Average Computational Cost of Image Tagging for a TensorFlow Model\n\nThe computational cost of image tagging with a TensorFlow model can be measured in terms of the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for inference. This cost varies based on the model's architecture and the size of the input image.\n\n- **FLOPs for Image Tagging**: For a commonly used model like MobileNetV2, which is often employed for image tagging tasks due to its balance between accuracy and efficiency, the computational cost can be approximately **300 million to 600 million FLOPs** per image, depending on the specific configuration and input size.\n\nThese figures provide a general guideline, and actual values can differ based on the specific model, optimizations applied, and the hardware on which the model runs.\n\n@EOF@[Average Size of Browser Model, Computational Cost of Image Tagging]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1097,"completion_tokens":299,"total_tokens":1396,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1097,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
