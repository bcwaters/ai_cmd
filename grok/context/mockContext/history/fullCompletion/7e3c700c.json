For example, `[abc]` matches any single character `a`, `b`, or `c`. You can also use ranges, such as `[a-z]` to match any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.\n\n2. **Quantifiers**:\n   - Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should be matched. For instance, `*` means zero or more occurrences, `+` means one or more occurrences, and `?` means zero or one occurrence. For example, `a*` matches zero or more `a`s, and `a+` matches one or more `a`s.\n\n@EOF@[Character Classes, Quantifiers]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":754,"completion_tokens":163,"total_tokens":917,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":754,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
