The sum of these numbers is:\n  \\[\n  S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n = 3k_1 + 3k_2 + \\cdots + 3k_n\n  \\]\n  Factoring out the 3, we get:\n  \\[\n  S = 3(k_1 + k_2 + \\cdots + k_n)\n  \\]\n  Let \\( t = k_1 + k_2 + \\cdots + k_n \\), which is an integer. Therefore:\n  \\[\n  S = 3t\n  \\]\n  Since \\( S \\) is expressed as 3 times an integer, \\( S \\) is divisible by 3.\n\n## Algebra\n\n- **Quadratic Equation:**\n  The general form of a quadratic equation is:\n  \\[\n  ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n  \\]\n  The solutions to this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:**\n  For a right triangle with legs \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and hypotenuse \\( c \\), the relationship between the sides is given by:\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n  \\]\n\n## Calculus\n\n- **Derivative:**\n  The derivative of a function \\( f(x) \\) is denoted as \\( f'(x) \\) and represents the rate of change of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\). For example, the derivative of \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is:\n  \\[\n  f'(x) = 2x\n  \\]\n\n- **Integral:**\n  The integral of a function \\( f(x) \\) represents the area under the curve of \\( f(x) \\). The indefinite integral of \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is:\n  \\[\n  \\int x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} + C\n  \\]\n  where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n## Physics\n\n- **Einstein's Equation:**\n  Einstein's famous equation relating mass and energy is:\n  \\[\n  E = mc^2\n  \\]\n  where \\( E \\) is energy, \\( m \\) is mass, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\n- **Newton's Second Law:**\n  Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n  \\[\n  F = ma\n  \\]\n  where \\( F \\) is force, \\( m \\) is mass, and \\( a \\) is acceleration.\n\n@EOF@\n[mathematical equations, number theory, algebra, calculus, physics, quadratic equation, pythagorean theorem, derivative, integral, einstein's equation, newton's second law]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":543,"completion_tokens":665,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1208,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":543,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
