It integrates seamlessly with Bash, Command Prompt, and PowerShell, offering functionalities like system information retrieval, script and CLI testing, and development support.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **System Information**: Utilize commands like `uname`, `lsb_release`, `systeminfo`, and `Get-ComputerInfo` to gather detailed system information.\n- **Visual Design and User Interface**: Enhance your command-line interface with ASCII art and colored output for a more engaging user experience.\n- **Audio and Equipment Setup**: Configure audio settings and manage equipment setups directly from the command line.\n- **Script and CLI Testing and Development**: Test scripts and develop CLI applications with ease using Grok's integrated testing tools.\n- **Node.js Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Node.js for enhanced scripting and development capabilities.\n- **Special Modes and Context Management**: Manage contexts and switch between special modes for different tasks.\n- **Black Orange Testing**: A specific mode for testing short response expectations and assistance.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use Grok, simply type `grok` followed by the command you wish to execute. For example:\n\n```bash\ngrok uname -a\n```\n\nThis command will display detailed information about your system using the `uname` command.\n\n## Configuration\n\nGrok can be configured using a configuration file. Here's an example of how to set up your configuration:\n\n```yaml\nsystem:\n  os: Linux\n  commands:\n    - uname\n    - lsb_release\nui:\n  ascii_art: true\n  color: true\naudio:\n  setup: true\nnode:\n  integration: true\nmodes:\n  - black_orange\n```\n\nSave this configuration in a file named `grok_config.yaml` in your home directory.\n\n## Special Modes\n\nGrok supports special modes for different tasks. Here's how to switch to the Black Orange mode:\n\n```bash\ngrok mode black_orange\n```\n\nThis mode is designed for testing short response expectations and providing assistance in a concise manner.\n\n## Node.js Integration\n\nTo leverage Node.js integration, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, you can use Grok to execute Node.js scripts directly from the command line:\n\n```bash\ngrok node my_script.js\n```\n\nThis command will run `my_script.js` using Node.js.\n\n## File Operations\n\nGrok also supports various file operations. Here's how to list files in a directory:\n\n```bash\ngrok ls -l\n```\n\nThis command will list all files in the current directory with detailed information.\n\n## Interactive CLI\n\nGrok provides an interactive CLI for easier navigation and execution of commands. To start the interactive mode, simply type:\n\n```bash\ngrok interactive\n```\n\nThis will open an interactive shell where you can execute Grok commands without needing to prefix them with `grok`.\n\n## ASCII Art and Colored Output\n\nTo enhance your user interface, Grok supports ASCII art and colored output. Here's an example of how to display a simple ASCII art:\n\n```bash\ngrok ascii art\n```\n\nAnd to enable colored output:\n\n```bash\ngrok color on\n```\n\nThis will make your command-line output more visually appealing.\n\n## Audio and Equipment Setup\n\nTo set up audio and equipment directly from the command line, use the following command:\n\n```bash\ngrok audio setup\n```\n\nThis will guide you through the process of configuring your audio settings and equipment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGrok is a versatile tool that enhances your command-line experience across various operating systems. With its wide range of features, from system information retrieval to Node.js integration, Grok is an essential tool for any developer or system administrator.\n\n@EOF@\n\n[system information, visual design, user interface, audio setup, equipment setup, script testing, CLI development, Node.js integration, special modes, context management, configuration, file operations, ASCII art, colored output, interactive CLI, Black Orange testing, short response expectations, assistance, Bash, Command Prompt, PowerShell, Unix/Linux/MacOS, Windows]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":272,"completion_tokens":836,"total_tokens":1108,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":272,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
