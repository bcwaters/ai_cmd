Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Packages\n\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You'll need `remark` for processing Markdown and a LaTeX renderer like `remark-math` or `remark-latex`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install remark remark-math\n```\n\n### Step 2: Configure Your Pipeline\n\nNext, configure your pipeline to use these plugins. Here's an example of how to set up a simple pipeline with `remark` and `remark-math`:\n\n```javascript\nconst unified = require('unified');\nconst remarkParse = require('remark-parse');\nconst remarkMath = require('remark-math');\nconst remarkStringify = require('remark-stringify');\n\nconst processor = unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkMath)\n  .use(remarkStringify);\n\n// Example usage\nconst markdownWithMath = `\n# Example\n\nThis is a simple equation: $E = mc^2$.\n`;\n\nprocessor.process(markdownWithMath, (err, file) => {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(String(file));\n});\n```\n\n### Step 3: Customize the LaTeX Rendering\n\nIf you need more control over how LaTeX is rendered, you might want to use a different plugin or a custom solution. For instance, you could use `remark-latex` for more advanced LaTeX support.\n\n```bash\nnpm install remark-latex\n```\n\nThen, modify your pipeline to use `remark-latex`:\n\n```javascript\nconst remarkLatex = require('remark-latex');\n\nconst processor = unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkLatex)\n  .use(remarkStringify);\n```\n\n### Step 4: Test and Refine\n\nAfter setting up the pipeline, test it with different LaTeX expressions to ensure they are rendered correctly. You may need to refine the configuration based on your specific needs, such as adjusting the LaTeX renderer settings or adding additional plugins for more complex mathematical expressions.\n\n### Step 5: Integration with Your Existing Workflow\n\nFinally, integrate this pipeline into your existing workflow. This might involve modifying build scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or other tools you use to process your documents.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully add Remark LaTeX to your unified pipeline, enabling you to render mathematical expressions within your Markdown documents.\n\n@EOF@[RemarkLaTeX, unifiedPipeline, npmPackages, JavaScriptIntegration, LaTeXRendering, MarkdownProcessing, BuildScripts]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":457,"completion_tokens":522,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":979,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":457,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
