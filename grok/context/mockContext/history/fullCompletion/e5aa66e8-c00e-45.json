This setup will allow you to render both Markdown and LaTeX equations within your README files.\n\n## Step 1: Setup\n\nFirst, you need to install the necessary packages. Run the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install marked katex\n```\n\n## Step 2: Configuration\n\nNext, configure `marked` to use KaTeX for rendering LaTeX equations. You will need a script to intercept the Markdown parsing and convert LaTeX equations to HTML.\n\nHere's an example of how you could set this up in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst marked = require('marked');\nconst katex = require('katex');\n\n// Configure marked to use KaTeX for rendering LaTeX\nmarked.use({\n  renderer: {\n    text(text) {\n      // Check if the text contains LaTeX and render it using KaTeX\n      if (text.match(/^\\$\\$[\\s\\S]*\\$\\$|\\$[\\s\\S]*\\$/)) {\n        try {\n          return katex.renderToString(text, { throwOnError: false });\n        } catch (err) {\n          return text;\n        }\n      }\n      return text;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Function to parse Markdown with LaTeX\nfunction parseMarkdownWithLaTeX(markdown) {\n  return marked.parse(markdown);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst markdownWithLaTeX = `# Heading\nThis is a paragraph with an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.\n\nAnd here is a displayed equation:\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\n\nYou can also use Markdown syntax like **bold** and *italic*.\n`;\n\nconsole.log(parseMarkdownWithLaTeX(markdownWithLaTeX));\n```\n\n## Step 3: Using in a README\n\nTo use this in a README, you would typically include the rendered output in your HTML or directly within a Markdown viewer that supports this setup. For example, if you're using a static site generator or a tool like GitHub Pages, you can include the JavaScript to process your README files.\n\n### Example README.md\n\n```markdown\n# Project Title\n\nThis project uses KaTeX for rendering LaTeX equations.\n\nHere's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.\n\nAnd a displayed equation:\n\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\n\nYou can also use standard Markdown syntax.\n```\n\nWhen viewed in a browser with the setup above, the README will render the LaTeX equations correctly.\n\nThis integration allows for a seamless experience where users can write README files with both Markdown and LaTeX, enhancing the documentation capabilities for technical projects.\n\n@EOF@\n[KaTeX, marked, README, LaTeX, Markdown, JavaScript, npm, rendering, integration, technical documentation]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":285,"completion_tokens":555,"total_tokens":840,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":285,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
