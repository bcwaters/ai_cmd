These examples cover various types of mathematical expressions, which should help you ensure your parser handles different LaTeX syntax correctly.\n\n### Inline Equations\n\nInline equations are typically used within text and are enclosed by single dollar signs `$...$`.\n\n- **Simple Equation**: $x + 5 = 10$\n- **Fraction**: The formula for the area of a circle is given by $A = \\pi r^2$.\n- **Exponent**: The exponential growth can be expressed as $P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}$.\n\n### Block Equations\n\nBlock equations are used for more complex expressions and are enclosed by double dollar signs `$$...$$` or `\\begin{equation}...\\end{equation}`.\n\n- **Quadratic Equation**:\n  $$\n  ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n  $$\n- **Integral**:\n  $$\n  \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n  $$\n- **Matrix**:\n  $$\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  a & b \\\\\n  c & d\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n  $$\n\n### More Advanced Equations\n\nThese examples test more complex LaTeX syntax.\n\n- **System of Equations**:\n  $$\n  \\begin{cases}\n  3x + 2y = 6 \\\\\n  x - y = 2\n  \\end{cases}\n  $$\n- **Derivative**:\n  $$\n  \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x^3 \\right) = 3x^2\n  $$\n- **Limit**:\n  $$\n  \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1\n  $$\n\nThese examples should give you a good starting point to test your LaTeX parser with a variety of mathematical expressions. Make sure to check both the rendering and the correctness of the parsed output.@EOF@[LaTeX, equations, parser, testing, inline, block, advanced, mathematical expressions, rendering, correctness]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":369,"completion_tokens":398,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":767,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":369,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
