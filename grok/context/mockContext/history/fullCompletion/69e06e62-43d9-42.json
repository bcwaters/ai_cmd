The slope represents the rate at which \\( y \\) changes with respect to \\( x \\). A slope of 2 means that for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) increases by 2 units. The slope also indicates the direction of the line; since it's positive, the line rises from left to right.\n\n## Y-Intercept (\\( b \\))\n\nThe y-intercept, denoted by \\( b \\), is 3. This value represents the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. In other words, when \\( x \\) is 0, \\( y \\) equals 3. The y-intercept gives us the starting point of the line on the y-axis before any change in \\( x \\) occurs.\n\n## Graphical Representation\n\nWhen plotting this equation on a graph, you would start at the point (0, 3) on the y-axis and move up 2 units and right 1 unit to find another point on the line. This process can be repeated to draw the entire line. The line will extend infinitely in both directions.\n\n## Examples and Calculations\n\n- If \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \\). So, the point (1, 5) lies on the line.\n- If \\( x = -2 \\), then \\( y = 2(-2) + 3 = -1 \\). So, the point (-2, -1) lies on the line.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nLinear equations are widely used in various fields:\n- **Economics**: To model cost, revenue, and profit functions.\n- **Physics**: To describe relationships between variables like distance, time, and velocity in uniform motion.\n- **Engineering**: For designing systems where a linear relationship between variables is assumed.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe linear equation \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) describes a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3. It can be used to predict the value of \\( y \\) for any given \\( x \\), and it has practical applications in numerous fields where linear relationships are relevant.\n\n@EOF@[Linear Equation, Slope, Y-Intercept, Graphical Representation, Examples, Real-World Applications, Summary]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":540,"completion_tokens":575,"total_tokens":1115,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":540,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
