Here's how you can modify your existing CSS to achieve this:\n\n```css\n.search-container input[type=\"text\"] {\n  padding: 5px;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 4px 0 0 4px;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  transition: border-color 0.3s ease;\n  width: 300px; /* Adjust this value to make the search bar wider */\n}\n\n/* For responsive design, you might want to keep the width at 100% for smaller screens */\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .search-container input[type=\"text\"] {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this modification:\n\n1. We've added a `width` property to the `.search-container input[type=\"text\"]` selector. You can adjust the `300px` value to make the search bar as wide as you want.\n\n2. We've kept the responsive design intact by maintaining `width: 100%` for screens with a maximum width of 600px. This ensures that on smaller devices, the search bar will still take up the full width of its container.\n\nYou can replace the existing `.search-container input[type=\"text\"]` rule in your CSS with this new version. If you want the search bar to be even wider, simply increase the `300px` value.\n\nRemember to test this change on different screen sizes to ensure it works well across various devices.\n\n@EOF@\nsearch bar, CSS, width, responsive design, mobile optimization","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2486,"completion_tokens":365,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":2851,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2486,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
