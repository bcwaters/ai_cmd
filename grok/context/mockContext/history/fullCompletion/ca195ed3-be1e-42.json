Specifically, the error states:\n\n```\nError accessing path ./shell_helpers: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"path\" argument must be of type string. Received an instance of Object\n```\n\nThis error occurs because the `path` argument provided to the `join` function from the `node:path` module is not a string as expected, but instead, it is an object.\n\n## What Happened?\n\n1. **Function Call**: The error is occurring in the `ProfileFileLoader.loadFileContent` function, which is called from `createApiRequest` in `grok.js`.\n2. **Incorrect Argument Type**: The `path.join` function is being called with an argument that is an instance of `Object` instead of a `string`.\n3. **Expected Behavior**: The `path.join` function expects all its arguments to be strings, which it then concatenates into a path.\n\n## How to Fix\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the path being passed to `path.join` is a string. Here are steps you can take:\n\n1. **Check the Data Source**: Verify where the path value is coming from. Make sure it's not accidentally being wrapped in an object or incorrectly formatted.\n2. **Convert to String**: If the path is stored in an object, you may need to extract the string value before passing it to `path.join`. For example, if the path is in an object like `obj.path`, use `obj.path.toString()` or `String(obj.path)`.\n3. **Debugging**: Add console logs or use a debugger to inspect the value of the path argument right before it's passed to `path.join`.\n\nHere's an example of how you might fix the code:\n\n```javascript\n// Before\nconst filePath = path.join(someObject);\n\n// After\nconst filePath = path.join(String(someObject.path));\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the code according to your actual data structure and requirements.\n\n@EOF@\n[error analysis, Node.js, path module, TypeError, argument type, path.join, string conversion, debugging, ProfileFileLoader, grok.js]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":459,"completion_tokens":465,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":924,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":459,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
