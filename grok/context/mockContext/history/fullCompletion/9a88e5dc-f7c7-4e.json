You might want to consider splitting the helper functions and dependencies into their own modules if they are not already.\n\n### Step 2: Exporting from `writeHtml.js`\n\nMake sure that `writeHtml.js` exports the `main()` function and any other necessary functions or objects. Here's how you might structure `writeHtml.js`:\n\n```javascript\n// writeHtml.js\n\n// Import any dependencies needed within this file\nconst utilClass1 = require('./utilClass1');\nconst utilClass2 = require('./utilClass2');\n\n// Helper functions\nfunction helperFunction1() {\n  // Implementation\n}\n\nfunction helperFunction2() {\n  // Implementation\n}\n\n// Main function\nfunction main() {\n  // Use helper functions and util classes\n  helperFunction1();\n  utilClass1.someMethod();\n  utilClass2.anotherMethod();\n}\n\n// Export the main function and any helper functions if needed\nmodule.exports = {\n  main,\n  helperFunction1,\n  helperFunction2\n};\n```\n\n### Step 3: Importing in the Express Server\n\nIn your Express server file, you can import the `main()` function along with any other required functions or objects. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\n// server.js\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// Import the main function from writeHtml.js\nconst { main } = require('./writeHtml');\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  // Call the main function from writeHtml.js\n  main();\n\n  // Send a response to the client\n  res.send('HTML file has been written');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Dependencies are Available\n\nEnsure that all the dependencies used in `writeHtml.js` are properly imported within that file or within the helper functions it calls. If the dependencies are in separate files, make sure those files are correctly exported and imported as shown in the example above.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Modularize**: If `writeHtml.js` is getting too large, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable modules. Each module can export specific functions that can be imported as needed.\n- **Testing**: After refactoring, make sure to test your application to ensure that all functionalities still work as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to refactor `writeHtml.js`, properly import the `main()` function, and ensure all dependencies are available for use in your Express server.\n\n@EOF@[refactor, writeHtml.js, main function, dependencies, Express server, import, export, modularization, helper functions, util classes]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":634,"completion_tokens":621,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1255,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":634,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
