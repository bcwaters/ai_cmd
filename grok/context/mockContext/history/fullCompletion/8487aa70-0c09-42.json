Here's how you can do it:\n\n## Step 1: Installation\n\nTo install `remark-highlight.js`, use the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install remark-highlight.js\n```\n\nThis command will add the `remark-highlight.js` package to your project, enabling you to use syntax highlighting when processing Markdown files.\n\n## Step 2: Integration\n\nAfter installation, you need to integrate `remark-highlight.js` into your unified pipeline. This is crucial for enabling syntax highlighting in your Markdown-to-HTML conversion process. Here's a basic example of how you might set up your pipeline:\n\n```javascript\nconst unified = require('unified')\nconst markdown = require('remark-parse')\nconst remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')\nconst html = require('rehype-stringify')\nconst highlight = require('remark-highlight.js')\n\nunified()\n  .use(markdown)\n  .use(highlight)\n  .use(remark2rehype)\n  .use(html)\n  .processSync('# Hello\\n\\n```js\\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\")\\n```')\n```\n\nIn this setup, `remark-highlight.js` is used to process code blocks and apply syntax highlighting before converting the Markdown to HTML.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Enhanced Readability**: Syntax highlighting makes code blocks in your Markdown documents more readable and professional.\n- **Improved Documentation**: Useful for creating detailed, technical documentation where code examples are common.\n- **Flexibility**: Can be used in various static site generators and other Markdown processing tools that support the unified ecosystem.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use `remark-highlight.js` to improve the presentation of code in your Markdown files.\n\n@EOF@\nKEYWORDS: remark-highlight.js, npm, installation, syntax highlighting, unified pipeline, Markdown processing, code blocks, JavaScript, text processing, documentation, static site generators","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":373,"completion_tokens":416,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":789,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":373,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
