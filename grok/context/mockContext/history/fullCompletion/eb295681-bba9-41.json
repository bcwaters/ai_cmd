You can install it using your package manager, for example, on Ubuntu:\n   ```sh\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install nginx\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Docker Network**: It's beneficial to create a Docker network to facilitate communication between containers and the host.\n   ```sh\n   docker network create my-network\n   ```\n\n3. **Run Docker Containers**: Start your Docker containers and connect them to the network you created. For example, if you're running a Node.js application:\n   ```sh\n   docker run --name myapp -p 3000:3000 --network my-network myapp-image\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure NGINX**: Create a new configuration file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory. For example, create a file named `myapp.conf`:\n   ```nginx\n   server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name example.com;\n\n       location / {\n           proxy_pass http://myapp:3000;\n           proxy_set_header Host $host;\n           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Link the Configuration**: Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:\n   ```sh\n   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n   ```\n\n6. **Test and Restart NGINX**: Test the configuration for errors and restart NGINX:\n   ```sh\n   sudo nginx -t\n   sudo systemctl restart nginx\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify the Setup**: Access your application through the NGINX server to ensure everything is working as expected.\n\nThis setup allows NGINX to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to your Docker container running the application.\n\n@EOF@\n[NGINX, reverse proxy, Docker, container networking, configuration, Node.js]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":296,"completion_tokens":456,"total_tokens":752,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":296,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
