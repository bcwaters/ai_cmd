This typically happens in Node.js when you're trying to use `import` statements in a script that is not recognized as a module.\n\n### Common Causes and Solutions:\n\n1. **Using `import` in a CommonJS Script:**\n   If your file is using the `.js` extension and you're trying to use `import` statements, Node.js by default treats `.js` files as CommonJS modules, which don't support `import` syntax natively. To fix this, you can either:\n   - Use the `.mjs` extension for your file, which tells Node.js to treat the file as an ES module:\n     ```javascript\n     // Rename yourfile.js to yourfile.mjs\n     import { something } from 'module';\n     ```\n   - Or, set `\"type\": \"module\"` in your `package.json` file to tell Node.js to treat all `.js` files in the project as ES modules:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"type\": \"module\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Running the Script Directly:**\n   If you're running your script directly with Node.js (e.g., `node yourfile.js`), ensure that Node.js is configured to run ES modules. You can specify the module type when running the script:\n   ```bash\n   node --input-type=module yourfile.js\n   ```\n\n3. **Incorrect Module Resolution:**\n   Ensure that any modules you're trying to import are correctly installed and accessible. Check your `node_modules` directory and your `package.json` for any discrepancies.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- If you're using a build tool or bundler like Webpack or Rollup, ensure your configuration supports ES modules and is set up correctly.\n- If you're transitioning from CommonJS to ES modules, be mindful of the differences in syntax and module resolution.\n\nFor more detailed guidance on handling modules in Node.js, refer to the [Node.js documentation on ES Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).\n\n@EOF@\n[SyntaxError, ES6Modules, CommonJS, Node.js, ModuleSyntax, importStatement, mjsExtension, package.json, typeModule, ESModuleConfiguration]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":481,"completion_tokens":496,"total_tokens":977,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":481,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
