Here's a detailed look at its characteristics based on the information provided earlier:\n\n### Orbital Characteristics\nJupiter orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 778 million kilometers, taking approximately 11.86 Earth years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is nearly circular, and its axial tilt is about 3.13 degrees, which is relatively small compared to other planets.\n\n### Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other compounds. The upper atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation, causing the distinctive banded appearance of the planet. Jupiter's atmosphere is known for its high-speed winds, which can reach speeds of up to 600 kilometers per hour, and its iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been observed for over 300 years.\n\n### Internal Structure\nBeneath its thick atmosphere, Jupiter is believed to have a mantle composed of metallic hydrogen, which surrounds a small, rocky core. The planet's internal heat source is significant, contributing to its active atmospheric phenomena, including storms and the Great Red Spot.\n\n### Moons and Rings\nJupiter has 79 known moons, the largest of which are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are notable for their diverse geological features and potential for subsurface oceans. Jupiter also has a faint ring system, discovered by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1979, composed of dust particles ejected from its moons.\n\n### Exploration\nJupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and the Galileo orbiter, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. The Juno spacecraft, launched in 2011, is currently studying Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure. Future missions to Jupiter are being considered, but none are currently planned, leaving much of the planet's mysteries yet to be explored.\n\nJupiter's stunning appearance, its large and diverse moon system, and its dynamic atmosphere make it a subject of continuous interest and study in the field of planetary science.\n\n@EOF@\n[ Jupiter, solar system, gas giant, 11.86-year orbit, atmosphere, hydrogen, helium, methane, Great Red Spot, moons, Galilean moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, rings, Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, Juno, exploration, future missions ]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":853,"completion_tokens":550,"total_tokens":1403,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":853,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
