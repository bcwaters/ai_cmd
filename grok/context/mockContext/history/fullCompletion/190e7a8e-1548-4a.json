Hereâ€™s how to set it up:\n\n## Step 1: Install Python Versions\nFirst, ensure you have multiple Python versions installed. You can use Homebrew to install different versions of Python:\n\n```bash\nbrew install python@3.9\nbrew install python@3.10\n```\n\n## Step 2: Choose Your Preferred Python Version\nDecide which version you want to be your default. For this example, let's assume you want Python 3.10 to be the default.\n\n## Step 3: Locate Python Installations\nFind the paths to your Python installations:\n\n```bash\nwhich python3.9\nwhich python3.10\n```\n\nThis will output something like `/usr/local/bin/python3.9` and `/usr/local/bin/python3.10`.\n\n## Step 4: Create Symlinks\nNavigate to the directory where your Python executables are located (usually `/usr/local/bin/`). Create a symlink for `python` and `python3` pointing to your preferred version:\n\n```bash\ncd /usr/local/bin\nln -s python3.10 python3\nln -s python3.10 python\n```\n\n## Step 5: Verify the Symlinks\nCheck if the symlinks are working correctly:\n\n```bash\npython --version\npython3 --version\n```\n\nBoth should return `Python 3.10.x`.\n\n## Step 6: Managing Multiple Environments\nTo manage multiple Python environments effectively, consider using a tool like `uv` (a faster alternative to `virtualenv` and `pip`). Install `uv` using Homebrew:\n\n```bash\nbrew install uv\n```\n\nThen, create and activate a virtual environment with `uv`:\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nNow, you can install packages and work within this environment without affecting your system-wide Python setup.\n\n## Additional Tips\n- **Use `uv` for faster package management and environment creation.**\n- **Consider using `pyenv` if you need to switch between multiple Python versions frequently.**\n- **Always be cautious when modifying system paths and ensure you have backups or can revert changes if needed.**\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a unified Python experience on your Mac, with the flexibility to use different versions as needed.\n\n@EOF@[\nInstall Python Versions,\nChoose Preferred Python,\nLocate Python Installations,\nCreate Symlinks,\nVerify Symlinks,\nManage Multiple Environments,\nAdditional Tips\n]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":413,"completion_tokens":528,"total_tokens":941,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":413,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
