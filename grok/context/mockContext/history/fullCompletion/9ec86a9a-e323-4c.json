Ask students to solve simple linear equations like $2x + 3 = 7$.\n2. **Introduction to Quadratics**: Introduce the concept of quadratic equations, explaining that they are polynomial equations of degree 2. Write a simple quadratic equation on the board, e.g., $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$.\n\n## Direct Instruction (20 minutes):\n1. **Understanding Quadratics**: Explain that quadratic equations can be written in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Discuss the significance of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n2. **Factoring Method**: Introduce the factoring method for solving quadratic equations. Use the example $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$ to demonstrate:\n   - Factor the quadratic expression: $(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$.\n   - Set each factor equal to zero: $x + 2 = 0$ and $x + 3 = 0$.\n   - Solve for $x$: $x = -2$ and $x = -3$.\n3. **Practice Example**: Solve another quadratic equation as a class, e.g., $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$, using the factoring method.\n\n## Guided Practice (15 minutes):\n1. **Worksheet Activity**: Distribute worksheets with several quadratic equations for students to solve using the factoring method. Walk around the classroom to provide assistance and check for understanding.\n2. **Group Work**: Encourage students to work in pairs to solve the equations and discuss their solutions.\n\n## Independent Practice (10 minutes):\n1. **Individual Work**: Assign a few more quadratic equations for students to solve on their own. This will help reinforce their understanding and allow them to practice independently.\n2. **Review**: Collect the worksheets and quickly review a few answers to ensure all students understand the concept.\n\n## Closure (5 minutes):\n1. **Summary**: Recap the key points of the lesson, emphasizing the standard form of quadratic equations and the steps to solve them using the factoring method.\n2. **Exit Ticket**: Ask students to write down one thing they learned about solving quadratic equations and one question they still have.\n\n## Assessment:\n- **Formative Assessment**: Monitor student participation and understanding during the guided and independent practice.\n- **Summative Assessment**: Use the exit tickets to gauge student learning and identify any areas needing further clarification.\n\n## Extension Activities:\n- For advanced students, introduce the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ and have them solve more complex quadratic equations.\n- Encourage students to create their own quadratic equations and solve them, fostering creativity and deeper understanding.\n\n@EOF@\n[Algebra, Quadratic Equations, Factoring Method, 5th Grade, Mathematics Education, Polynomials, Standard Form, Independent Practice, Guided Practice, Assessment]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1125,"completion_tokens":709,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1834,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1125,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
