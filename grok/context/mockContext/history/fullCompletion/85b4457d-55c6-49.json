They have both gills and lungs.\n\n- **Electric Eels**: Electric eels can generate electric shocks of up to 600 volts to stun prey and defend themselves.\n\n- **Glowing Fish**: Some deep-sea fish, like the anglerfish, have bioluminescent organs that produce light to attract prey in the dark depths.\n\n- **Fish Schools**: Fish often swim in schools for protection from predators. The synchronized movement can confuse predators and make it harder for them to target an individual fish.\n\n- **Fast Swimmers**: The sailfish is the fastest fish in the ocean, capable of swimming at speeds up to 68 miles per hour.\n\n- **Temperature Regulation**: Some fish, like the tuna and the great white shark, can maintain a body temperature higher than the surrounding water, a process known as regional endothermy.\n\n- **Coral Reefs**: Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine life, including thousands of fish species, despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor.\n\n@EOF@\n[fish, species, ancient, space, lungfish, electric eel, bioluminescence, schools, sailfish, temperature, coral reefs]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1016,"completion_tokens":379,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1395,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1016,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
