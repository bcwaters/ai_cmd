The Pythagorean Theorem\n\n**Statement:** In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n**Mathematical Expression:** For a right triangle with sides of length \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse of length \\(c\\), the theorem states:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\n**Coolness Factor:** This theorem is foundational in geometry and has numerous applications, from calculating distances in Cartesian coordinates to its use in various fields like architecture and engineering. Its proof can be visualized through many different methods, making it a favorite in mathematics education.\n\n## 2. The Inscribed Angle Theorem\n\n**Statement:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.\n\n**Mathematical Expression:** If an inscribed angle \\(\\angle ABC\\) intercepts arc \\(\\stackrel{\\frown}{AC}\\) on a circle, then:\n\\[ \\angle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{arc} \\stackrel{\\frown}{AC} \\]\n\n**Coolness Factor:** This theorem elegantly connects the properties of circles and angles, allowing for the calculation of angles and arcs with ease. It's particularly cool because it simplifies complex geometric problems and has applications in fields like astronomy for calculating celestial angles.\n\n@EOF@[The Pythagorean Theorem, The Inscribed Angle Theorem]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":655,"completion_tokens":303,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":958,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":655,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
