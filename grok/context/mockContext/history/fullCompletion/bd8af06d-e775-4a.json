Here's a basic configuration:\n\n   ```html\n   <script>\n     window.MathJax = {\n       tex: {\n         inlineMath: [['$', '$'], [\"\\\\(\", \"\\\\)\"]]\n       }\n     };\n   </script>\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\n3. **Write Your Math Equations:**\n   Now you can write math equations in your HTML using the delimiters you configured. For example:\n\n   ```html\n   <p>Here is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.</p>\n   <p>And here is a displayed equation: $$E = mc^2$$</p>\n   ```\n\n4. **Testing Your Setup:**\n   Load your webpage in a browser to see if the equations are rendered correctly. If they are not, check your console for any errors and ensure that the MathJax script is loaded properly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should have MathJax set up and ready to use on your website.\n\n@EOF@[MathJax, setup, configuration, HTML, equations, CDN, inline, displayed]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":275,"completion_tokens":344,"total_tokens":619,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":275,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
