Its primary function is to identify and extract mathematical expressions written in LaTeX syntax from Markdown text.\n- **Usage**: It is typically used as part of a processing pipeline in tools like `unified`, where it prepares the math expressions for further processing. It does not render the math; it simply recognizes and isolates it within the Markdown text.\n- **Integration**: It is often used in conjunction with other plugins to convert Markdown to other formats, such as HTML, where the math can then be rendered.\n- **Example**: In the context of the steps provided, `remarkMath` would be used to detect and mark LaTeX expressions in the Markdown, preparing them for subsequent rendering by a tool like KaTeX.\n\n### KaTeX\n\n- **Purpose**: KaTeX is a fast JavaScript library for rendering mathematical expressions on the web. It takes LaTeX expressions as input and outputs HTML and CSS to display the math.\n- **Usage**: KaTeX is used to render the LaTeX expressions into visually appealing and correctly formatted mathematical symbols and equations. It is the rendering engine that actually displays the math on a webpage.\n- **Integration**: In the setup described in the steps, KaTeX is used via the `rehype-katex` plugin, which applies KaTeX rendering to the HTML output after the Markdown has been converted to HTML.\n- **Example**: In the provided code, `rehype-katex` is used to process the LaTeX expressions identified by `remarkMath` and convert them into HTML that can be displayed in a browser.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **remarkMath** identifies and isolates LaTeX expressions in Markdown, preparing them for rendering.\n- **KaTeX** renders the LaTeX expressions into HTML and CSS for display on the web.\n\nBoth tools are essential in a pipeline for processing Markdown with embedded LaTeX, where `remarkMath` prepares the math for rendering, and KaTeX does the actual rendering.@EOF@[remarkMath, KaTeX, LaTeX, Markdown, Rendering, Parsing, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, unified]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":808,"completion_tokens":470,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1278,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":808,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
