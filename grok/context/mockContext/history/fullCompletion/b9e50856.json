Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Running the Docker Image\n\n1. **Basic Run Command:**\n   If your image is tagged as `aicmdtest`, you can run it with:\n   ```bash\n   docker run aicmdtest\n   ```\n\n2. **Running in Detached Mode:**\n   To run the container in the background, use the `-d` flag:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -d aicmdtest\n   ```\n\n3. **Port Mapping:**\n   If your application inside the container listens on a port, you'll need to map it to a port on your host machine. For example, if your app listens on port 80 inside the container and you want to access it on port 8080 on your host:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -p 8080:80 aicmdtest\n   ```\n\n4. **Environment Variables:**\n   You can set environment variables inside the container using the `-e` flag:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -e \"ENV_VAR=some_value\" aicmdtest\n   ```\n\n5. **Volume Mounts:**\n   To mount a directory from your host to the container, use the `-v` flag:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -v /host/directory:/container/directory aicmdtest\n   ```\n\n6. **Interactive Mode:**\n   To run the container in interactive mode, use the `-it` flags:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -it aicmdtest /bin/bash\n   ```\n   This will start a bash session inside the container.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- Ensure your image is tagged correctly when you build it. If you used a different tag, replace `aicmdtest` with your actual tag in the `docker run` commands.\n- If your container needs to be run with specific user permissions or capabilities, you might need to adjust the run command accordingly.\n\nTry running your Docker image with these commands and let me know if you encounter any issues.\n\n@EOF@\ndocker, run, container, image, port mapping, environment variables, volume mounts, interactive mode, detached mode","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":655,"completion_tokens":457,"total_tokens":1112,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":655,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
