Here's a detailed breakdown of how it functions:\n\n- **Input Processing**: When a user submits a query, the system first processes the input to understand the context and requirements. This involves parsing the text to identify key elements such as the main topic, any specific questions, and the format requested.\n\n- **Contextual Understanding**: The system uses the provided context to tailor the response. In the case of the initial query, it was noted that this was the beginning of the conversation, which influences how the system generates the response without prior history.\n\n- **Response Generation**: The response is crafted in Markdown format as per the user's request. The system ensures that the response adheres to the specified format, including headings, lists, and any other Markdown elements.\n\n- **Follow-up Suggestions**: After the main response, the system suggests follow-up questions to keep the conversation flowing and to help the user explore related topics.\n\n- **Delimiter and Keywords**: The system includes an `@EOF@` delimiter to separate the main response from a list of keywords. These keywords are SEO-style and aim to encapsulate the essential information provided in the response.\n\n- **Markdown Compliance**: All responses are strictly in Markdown, ensuring readability and structure.\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n- Can you explain how the system handles complex queries?\n- What are the benefits of using Markdown in responses?\n- How does the system decide on the keywords to include after the `@EOF@` delimiter?\n\n@EOF@[system operations, markdown usage, query processing, contextual response, SEO keywords]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":213,"completion_tokens":332,"total_tokens":545,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":213,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
