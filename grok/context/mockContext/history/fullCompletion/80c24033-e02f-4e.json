Below are some fundamental equations commonly used in this field:\n\n## 1. Fourier Transform\n\nThe Fourier Transform is used to transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. The equation for the continuous Fourier transform is:\n\n$$ X(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-j2\\pi f t} \\, dt $$\n\nWhere:\n- $X(f)$ is the Fourier transform of the signal $x(t)$.\n- $t$ is time.\n- $f$ is frequency.\n- $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n\n## 2. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\n\nFor digital signals, the Discrete Fourier Transform is used. The equation for DFT is:\n\n$$ X(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn} $$\n\nWhere:\n- $X(k)$ is the $k$th element of the DFT of $x(n)$.\n- $N$ is the number of samples.\n- $n$ and $k$ are integers ranging from 0 to $N-1$.\n\n## 3. Convolution\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operation used to express the output of a linear time-invariant system. The convolution of two functions $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$ (f * g)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau) \\, d\\tau $$\n\nIn the discrete case, it becomes:\n\n$$ (f * g)[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f[m] g[n-m] $$\n\n## 4. Z-Transform\n\nThe Z-Transform is used for analyzing discrete-time signals and systems. The equation for the Z-Transform of a sequence $x[n]$ is:\n\n$$ X(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} $$\n\nWhere:\n- $X(z)$ is the Z-Transform of the sequence $x[n]$.\n- $z$ is a complex variable.\n\n## 5. Laplace Transform\n\nThe Laplace Transform is used to solve differential equations and is particularly useful in control systems. The equation for the Laplace Transform of a function $f(t)$ is:\n\n$$ F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \\, dt $$\n\nWhere:\n- $F(s)$ is the Laplace Transform of $f(t)$.\n- $s$ is a complex frequency parameter.\n\nThese equations form the backbone of many signal processing techniques, enabling engineers and scientists to analyze and manipulate signals effectively.\n\n@EOF@\nsignal processing, Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, Convolution, Z-Transform, Laplace Transform, time domain, frequency domain, linear systems, control systems","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":688,"completion_tokens":577,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1265,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":688,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
