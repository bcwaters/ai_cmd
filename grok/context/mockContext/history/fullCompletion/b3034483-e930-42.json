This is done by evaluating a criterion, commonly Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression.\n\n3. **Is Split Better?**: If the split reduces the MSE (or another chosen metric), the algorithm proceeds to create a split node.\n\n4. **Leaf Node**: If no beneficial split is found, the node becomes a leaf node, and it will predict the average (or another central tendency measure) of the target values of the instances that reach this node.\n\n5. **Split Node**: If a beneficial split is found, the node splits into two child nodes (left and right subtrees), and the process repeats for these subtrees.\n\n6. **Left Subtree and Right Subtree**: The data is divided based on the split condition, and the algorithm continues recursively until it reaches the stopping criteria (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).\n\nThis process constructs a tree structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node contains a prediction value.\n\n@EOF@\n[DecisionTreeRegressor, algorithm, ASCII, machine learning, regression, tree structure, split criteria, leaf node,]\n","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":302,"completion_tokens":382,"total_tokens":684,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":302,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
