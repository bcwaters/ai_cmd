It allows users to train a model to recognize images, sounds, or poses without writing any code. This application demonstrates the power of TensorFlow.js by making machine learning accessible to a broader audience, showcasing real-time model training and inference in the browser.\n\n```javascript\n// Example of using TensorFlow.js in Teachable Machine\nconst model = await tmImage.loadFromFiles(video, {\n  tmFile: 'model.tm',\n  metadataFile: 'metadata.json',\n  weightsFile: 'weights.bin'\n});\n\nconst prediction = await model.predict(video);\nconsole.log(prediction);\n```\n\n## Microsoft's Azure Custom Vision\n\nMicrosoft leverages TensorFlow.js in its Azure Custom Vision service to provide a browser-based interface for training and deploying image classification models. Users can upload images, train a model, and then use the trained model directly in the browser for real-time predictions. This application highlights the scalability and ease of use of TensorFlow.js for enterprise-level machine learning tasks.\n\n```javascript\n// Example of using TensorFlow.js in Azure Custom Vision\nconst model = await cocoSsd.load();\nconst predictions = await model.detect(document.getElementById('img'));\n\npredictions.forEach(prediction => {\n  console.log(prediction);\n});\n```\n\n@EOF@[Google's Teachable Machine, Microsoft's Azure Custom Vision]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1457,"completion_tokens":299,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1756,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1457,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
