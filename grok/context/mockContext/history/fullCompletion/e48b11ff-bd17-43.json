In this formula:\n- \\( x \\) represents the solutions (roots) of the quadratic equation.\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n- The \\(\\pm\\) symbol indicates that there are two possible solutions, one using the plus sign and the other using the minus sign.\n- The expression under the square root, \\( b^2 - 4ac \\), is known as the discriminant, which determines the nature of the roots.\n\nTo render this equation, you would again use tools like KaTeX or MathJax after processing the Markdown with plugins such as remark-math and rehype-katex. This process involves identifying and isolating the LaTeX within the Markdown, followed by rendering it into HTML and CSS for display.\n\n@EOF@\n[LaTeX, quadratic formula, KaTeX, MathJax, remark-math, rehype-katex, rendering, Markdown, HTML, CSS]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":405,"completion_tokens":251,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":656,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":405,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
