The concept of \"Keeping Still\" is deeply rooted in the idea of inner peace and contemplation, which is essential for personal growth and understanding.\n\n## Symbolism and Meaning\n\n- **Stillness**: Gen represents the state of being motionless, both physically and mentally.

By keeping still, one can delve deeper into their inner self, gaining insights and wisdom.\n- **Inner Peace**: Achieving inner peace is a central theme of Gen. This peace comes from the ability to quiet the mind and focus on the present moment, free from distractions.\n- **Contemplation**: The hexagram suggests that through contemplation, one can achieve clarity and understanding.
