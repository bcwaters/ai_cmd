These references, primarily found in the Psalms, offer insights into the broader impact of his rule and the theological significance of his actions.\n\n### Psalms\n\n**Psalm 72:1**\n> \"Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.\"\n\nThis verse is traditionally understood as a prayer for Solomon, attributed to David. It reflects the hope that Solomon would rule with divine justice and righteousness, which aligns with the biblical portrayal of Solomon's early reign as one marked by wisdom and justice. This prayer underscores the expectation that Solomon's governance would be a continuation of the divine covenant with David, emphasizing the importance of righteous rule in maintaining the stability and prosperity of the kingdom.\n\n**Psalm 127:1**\n> \"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.\"\n\nThis psalm is often attributed to Solomon, though the text itself does not explicitly mention him. It speaks to the futility of human efforts without divine guidance and protection, a theme that resonates with Solomon's own experiences. The mention of building a house can be seen as a direct reference to Solomon's construction of the Temple, which was a significant achievement of his reign. The psalm emphasizes that even monumental projects like the Temple are ultimately dependent on God's blessing and involvement.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n- **Theological Implications**: The references in Psalms highlight the theological framework within which Solomon's reign is understood. His success and failures are seen as part of God's larger plan for Israel, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God's commandments.\n\n- **Cultural Impact**: Solomon's wisdom and wealth are celebrated in these texts, reinforcing his status as a legendary figure in Jewish tradition. The mention of his carriage in Song of Solomon 3:7, for instance, underscores his royal splendor and the respect he commanded.\n\n- **Moral and Ethical Lessons**: The passages also serve as moral and ethical lessons. For instance, the futility of human efforts without divine guidance in Psalm 127:1 can be seen as a cautionary tale for leaders and builders, reflecting on Solomon's own life where his later years were marred by idolatry and moral decline.\n\nThese other mentions of Solomon in the Bible enrich our understanding of his character and reign, providing a more nuanced view of his legacy beyond the more direct accounts in Kings, Chronicles, and the wisdom literature. They highlight the interplay between divine favor, human effort, and the moral responsibilities of leadership.\n\n@EOF@[Other Solomon Mentions, Psalms, Theological Implications, Cultural Impact, Moral and Ethical Lessons]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2102,"completion_tokens":575,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":2677,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":2102,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
