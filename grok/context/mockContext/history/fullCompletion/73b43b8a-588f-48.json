This equation represents a parabola, which is a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve on a graph.\n\n## Detailed Explanation of Components\n\n- **\\(a\\)**: This coefficient determines the direction and width of the parabola. If \\(a > 0\\), the parabola opens upwards, and if \\(a < 0\\), it opens downwards. The absolute value of \\(a\\) affects the steepness of the parabola; a larger absolute value makes the parabola narrower, while a smaller absolute value makes it wider.\n\n- **\\(b\\)**: This coefficient affects the position of the parabola along the x-axis. It shifts the parabola horizontally and influences the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. The term \\(bx\\) also affects the symmetry of the parabola about the axis of symmetry.\n\n- **\\(c\\)**: This constant term represents the y-intercept of the parabola, which is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis. It shifts the parabola vertically.\n\n## Solving Quadratic Equations\n\nThere are several methods to solve quadratic equations:\n\n### 1. **Factoring**\n\nIf the quadratic equation can be factored into the form \\((px + q)(rx + s) = 0\\), then the solutions are found by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n\\[\npx + q = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad rx + s = 0\n\\]\n\n### 2. **Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe quadratic formula provides a direct method to find the roots of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, the term under the square root, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), is called the discriminant. It determines the nature of the roots:\n\n- If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.\n- If the discriminant is zero, there is one real root (a repeated root).\n- If the discriminant is negative, there are two complex conjugate roots.\n\n### 3. **Completing the Square**\n\nThis method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial:\n\n\\[\nax^2 + bx + c = a\\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) after setting the equation to zero gives the roots.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nQuadratic equations are used in various fields:\n\n- **Physics**: To describe the motion of objects under the influence of gravity, such as projectile motion.\n- **Engineering**: For designing parabolic reflectors in satellite dishes and telescopes.\n- **Economics**: To model profit and cost functions, where the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function can represent the optimal production level.\n- **Biology**: To model population growth or decay over time.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Solving a Quadratic Equation\n\nConsider the equation \\(2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0\\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Example 2: Projectile Motion\n\nIf a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 30 m/s from a height of 2 meters, its height \\(h\\) as a function of time \\(t\\) can be modeled by:\n\n\\[\nh(t) = -4.9t^2 + 30t + 2\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation where the maximum height can be found by determining the vertex of the parabola.\n\n@EOF@[Quadratic Equation, Components, Solving, Factoring, Quadratic Formula, Completing the Square, Real-World Applications, Physics, Engineering, Economics, Biology, Examples, Projectile Motion]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":503,"completion_tokens":866,"total_tokens":1369,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":503,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
