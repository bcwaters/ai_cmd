Alternatively, you can set up your application to read from environment variables that are set at runtime.\n\n   ```Dockerfile\n   FROM ubuntu:latest\n\n   # Install necessary tools\n   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git\n\n   # Clone your repository\n   RUN git clone <your-repo-url> /app\n\n   # Set the working directory\n   WORKDIR /app\n\n   # Copy the .env file into the container (if using during build)\n   # COPY .env .env\n\n   # Specify the command to run on container start\n   CMD [\"bash\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Environment Variables at Runtime**: The recommended approach is to pass the environment variables directly when running the container. You can do this using the `-e` flag or by mounting the `.env` file as a volume.\n\n   - **Using `-e` flag**:\n\n     ```bash\n     docker run -it -e VAR1=value1 -e VAR2=value2 <your-image-name>\n     ```\n\n   - **Mounting `.env` file as a volume**:\n\n     ```bash\n     docker run -it --env-file .env <your-image-name>\n     ```\n\n     Or, if you need to specify the path to the `.env` file:\n\n     ```bash\n     docker run -it --env-file /path/to/.env <your-image-name>\n     ```\n\n4. **Accessing Variables in Your Application**: Ensure your application code is configured to read from these environment variables. For example, in a Python application, you might use:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   var1 = os.environ.get('VAR1')\n   var2 = os.environ.get('VAR2')\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can securely manage and load private `.env` variables when running your Docker container.\n\n@EOF@\ndocker, .env, environment variables, security, Dockerfile, runtime, container, volume mount, application configuration","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":647,"completion_tokens":505,"total_tokens":1152,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":647,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
