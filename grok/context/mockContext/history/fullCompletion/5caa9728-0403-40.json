Here are its primary uses:\n\n- **CGI Execution**: fcgiwrap allows traditional CGI scripts to be run in a FastCGI environment, which can improve performance and scalability compared to traditional CGI.\n\n- **Compatibility**: It provides a bridge between modern web servers like NGINX that support FastCGI and older applications that are written as CGI scripts, ensuring compatibility without needing to rewrite the applications.\n\n- **Integration with NGINX**: When used with NGINX, fcgiwrap can handle CGI requests efficiently, making it suitable for environments where NGINX is used as a reverse proxy or load balancer.\n\n- **Security**: By running CGI scripts in a controlled FastCGI environment, fcgiwrap can help enforce security policies, such as running scripts with least privilege.\n\n- **Performance**: Since FastCGI processes can be reused, fcgiwrap helps in reducing the overhead of starting a new process for each CGI request, thus enhancing server performance.\n\n- **Maintenance**: It simplifies the management of CGI applications by centralizing their execution through FastCGI, which can ease maintenance and updates.\n\n@EOF@\n[fcgiwrap, CGI, FastCGI, NGINX, performance, security, compatibility, maintenance]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":284,"completion_tokens":265,"total_tokens":549,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":284,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
