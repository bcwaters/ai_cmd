Input the value `5` into the function.\n2. Execute the function.\n3. Compare the output to the expected result `25`.\n\n**Expected Result:** The function should return `25`.\n\n**Actual Result:** The function returned `25`.\n\n**Status:** Passed\n```\n\nThis format helps in clearly documenting and sharing test results.\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n- Do you need help with writing test cases in a specific programming language?\n- Would you like to see more examples of test case documentation?\n- Are there particular aspects of testing you're interested in learning more about?\n\n@EOF@[markdown, testing, test case, documentation, example, follow-up questions]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":188,"completion_tokens":184,"total_tokens":372,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":188,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
