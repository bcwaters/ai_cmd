The angles opposite these equal sides are also equal.\n\n- **Definition**: A triangle with at least two sides of equal length.\n- **Properties**:\n  - Two sides are congruent: $a = b$ or $b = c$ or $a = c$.\n  - The angles opposite the equal sides are congruent: $\\angle A = \\angle B$ or $\\angle B = \\angle C$ or $\\angle A = \\angle C$.\n  - The altitude from the vertex angle to the base bisects the base and the vertex angle.\n\n## Obtuse Triangle\n\nAn **obtuse triangle** is a triangle that has one angle greater than $90^\\circ$ but less than $180^\\circ$. The other two angles must be acute (less than $90^\\circ$).\n\n- **Definition**: A triangle with one angle greater than $90^\\circ$.\n- **Properties**:\n  - One angle is obtuse: $\\angle A > 90^\\circ$ or $\\angle B > 90^\\circ$ or $\\angle C > 90^\\circ$.\n  - The other two angles are acute: $\\angle A < 90^\\circ$, $\\angle B < 90^\\circ$, and $\\angle C < 90^\\circ$.\n  - The longest side is opposite the obtuse angle.\n\nThese definitions and properties help distinguish between these types of triangles and are fundamental in geometric studies.@EOF@equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, triangles, geometry, equal sides, equal angles, obtuse angle, acute angles","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1085,"completion_tokens":475,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1560,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1085,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
