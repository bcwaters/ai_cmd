Here's a basic usage:\n\n```bash\ngrep \"pattern\" file.txt\n```\n\n## Adding Flags\n\nTo enhance the functionality of `grep`, you can use various flags:\n\n- `-i` for case-insensitive search\n- `-r` for recursive search in directories\n- `-n` to include line numbers in the output\n\nHere's an example with multiple flags:\n\n```bash\ngrep -inr \"pattern\" directory/\n```\n\n## Multiple Files and Sequential Commands\n\nIf you want to search through multiple files or use sequential commands, you can do the following:\n\n```bash\ngrep -in \"pattern\" file1.txt file2.txt\n```\n\nOr for sequential commands:\n\n```bash\ngrep -in \"pattern1\" file1.txt | grep -in \"pattern2\"\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\nLet's say you want to search for the word \"testing\" in multiple files within a directory, case-insensitively, and with line numbers:\n\n```bash\ngrep -inr \"testing\" /path/to/directory/\n```\n\n## Shell Command Documentation Format\n\nWhen documenting shell commands, it's useful to include:\n\n- The command itself\n- A brief explanation\n- Example usage\n- Expected output\n\n## Testing Functionality\n\nTo confirm the sequence works as expected, you can test with known inputs:\n\n```bash\necho \"Testing one two three\" > testfile.txt\ngrep -in \"testing\" testfile.txt\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\n1:Testing one two three\n```\n\n## Custom AI\n\nOur custom AI model is designed to be context-aware, user-specific, and personalized.
