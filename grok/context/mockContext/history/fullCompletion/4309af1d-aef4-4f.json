It's a collection of variable assignments defining ANSI color codes. These variables can be used in a terminal or shell script to colorize output. Therefore, the runtime of this script itself is effectively zero, as it doesn't perform any operations beyond setting up these variables.\n\nIf you're asking about the runtime environment where these color codes would be used, it would typically be in a terminal or command-line interface (CLI) on Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux. The color codes are compatible with terminals that support ANSI escape sequences.\n\n### Banner\n\nThere is no explicit banner in the provided script. However, if you're referring to a potential use of these color codes to create a banner in a terminal, you could use these variables to style text in various colors. Here's an example of how you might create a simple banner using these color codes:\n\n```bash\necho -e \"${color_blue_light}===${color_reset} Welcome to My Terminal ${color_blue_light}===${color_reset}\"\n```\n\nThis would output a banner with light blue borders and the text \"Welcome to My Terminal\" in the default terminal color.\n\nIf you intended to have a banner in your script, you would need to add such a line or a more elaborate script to display it.\n\n@EOF@\n\nTerminalColorCodes, ANSIColorCodes, RuntimeEnvironment, UnixLikeSystems, TerminalBanner, ColorizedOutput","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3342,"completion_tokens":317,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":3659,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":3342,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
