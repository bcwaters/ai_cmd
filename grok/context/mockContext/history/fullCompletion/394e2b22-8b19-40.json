This plugin is designed specifically to handle LaTeX mathematical expressions embedded within HTML documents and convert them into renderable KaTeX format, which is a fast and efficient JavaScript library for rendering LaTeX math on the web.\n\n## Functionality and Usage\n\n### Basic Setup\n\nTo integrate `rehype-katex` into your project, you'll need to set up a processing pipeline using the `unified` processor. Here's an expanded example of how you might configure this:\n\n```javascript\nconst unified = require('unified');\nconst rehypeParse = require('rehype-parse');\nconst rehypeKatex = require('rehype-katex');\nconst rehypeStringify = require('rehype-stringify');\n\nunified()\n  .use(rehypeParse, { fragment: true }) // Parse HTML\n  .use(rehypeKatex) // Convert LaTeX to KaTeX\n  .use(rehypeStringify) // Output HTML\n  .process('<p>$E=mc^2$</p>', (err, file) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(String(file));\n  });\n```\n\nIn this setup, `rehype-parse` parses the HTML input, `rehype-katex` processes the LaTeX math, and `rehype-stringify` converts the result back into HTML with KaTeX rendering.\n\n### Advanced Options\n\n`rehype-katex` can be configured with several options to customize its behavior:\n\n- **ThrowOnError**: By default, `rehype-katex` will throw an error if it encounters an invalid LaTeX expression. You can set this to `false` to ignore errors and continue processing.\n- **Macros**: You can define custom LaTeX macros to be used during processing. This is useful for defining frequently used symbols or formatting.\n\nHere's an example of how to use these options:\n\n```javascript\nunified()\n  .use(rehypeParse, { fragment: true })\n  .use(rehypeKatex, {\n    throwOnError: false,\n    macros: {\n      '\\\\RR': '\\\\mathbb{R}'\n    }\n  })\n  .use(rehypeStringify)\n  .process('<p>$E=mc^2$, $x \\\\in \\\\RR$</p>', (err, file) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(String(file));\n  });\n```\n\n### Integration with Other Plugins\n\n`rehype-katex` can be combined with other `rehype` plugins to create a more comprehensive processing pipeline. For instance, you might want to add syntax highlighting for code blocks or handle other types of content within your documents.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nKaTeX is designed to be fast, but the performance can vary based on the complexity of the LaTeX expressions and the number of expressions in the document. For large documents or documents with many complex expressions, consider optimizing the rendering process or splitting the document into smaller chunks.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nKaTeX works well in modern browsers, but you should ensure that your target audience's browsers support the necessary features. KaTeX provides polyfills for older browsers if needed.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nWhen using `rehype-katex`, consider the accessibility of your mathematical content. KaTeX can generate accessible MathML, but you may need to configure this manually or use additional plugins to ensure your math is accessible to screen readers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n`rehype-katex` is a powerful tool for anyone looking to embed and render LaTeX math within HTML documents. Its integration with the `unified` ecosystem makes it versatile and easy to combine with other document processing tools. Whether you're creating educational content, technical documentation, or any other type of document that requires mathematical expressions, `rehype-katex` can help you achieve professional and accessible results.\n\n---\n\n**Follow-up questions:**\n\n- Do you need help integrating `rehype-katex` into a larger project?\n- Are you interested in learning about other plugins that can be used with LaTeX in unified?\n- Would you like to see examples of how `rehype-katex` handles more complex LaTeX expressions?\n\n@EOF@[rehype-katex, LaTeX, KaTeX, unified, HTML, math rendering, plugin, processing pipeline, JavaScript, browser compatibility, accessibility, performance, configuration, macros, error handling, integration]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":828,"completion_tokens":923,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1751,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":828,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
