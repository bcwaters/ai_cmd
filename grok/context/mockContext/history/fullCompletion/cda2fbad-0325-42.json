It has a large community and is used in research and production environments.\n   - **Contribution Areas**: Model optimization, new model architectures, documentation, and example projects.\n   - **Link**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n\n2. **PyTorch**\n   - **Description**: Created by Meta AI, PyTorch is known for its ease of use and dynamic computational graph. It's popular in both academic and industry settings.\n   - **Contribution Areas**: New features, performance improvements, and tutorials.\n   - **Link**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)\n\n3. **scikit-learn**\n   - **Description**: A machine learning library for the Python programming language, it features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.\n   - **Contribution Areas**: New algorithms, performance enhancements, and educational resources.\n   - **Link**: [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n\n4. **Keras**\n   - **Description**: An API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load and can run on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano.\n   - **Contribution Areas**: New layers, model architectures, and usability improvements.\n   - **Link**: [Keras](https://keras.io/)\n\n5. **Hugging Face Transformers**\n   - **Description**: A library that provides state-of-the-art machine learning models for natural language processing (NLP).\n   - **Contribution Areas**: New models, model fine-tuning, and integration with other libraries.\n   - **Link**: [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)\n\n6. **Apache MXNet**\n   - **Description**: A deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility, it allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity.\n   - **Contribution Areas**: New operators, performance optimizations, and documentation.\n   - **Link**: [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/)\n\n7. **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**\n   - **Description**: An open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them.\n   - **Contribution Areas**: New converter tools, model optimizations, and documentation.\n   - **Link**: [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/)\n\nWhen choosing a library to contribute to, consider your interests, the community's needs, and your skill set. Engaging with the community through forums, GitHub issues, and contributing to documentation can be a great way to start.\n\n@EOF@[machine learning, open source, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras, Hugging Face, Apache MXNet, ONNX, contribution, community, NLP, deep learning, GitHub]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":554,"completion_tokens":633,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1187,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":554,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
