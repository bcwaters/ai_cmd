Here's how you can approach this:\n\n## Understanding remarkMath\n\n`remarkMath` is a plugin for the `remark` ecosystem, which processes Markdown and can handle inline and display math. It recognizes common LaTeX syntax, but if you need to handle specific cases like multiple `$` symbols, you might need to customize it.\n\n## Customization Steps\n\n1. **Extend the Parser**: You can extend the existing parser to recognize new syntax patterns. This might involve modifying the regular expressions used by `remarkMath` to match LaTeX syntax.\n\n2. **Plugin Configuration**: If `remarkMath` allows for configuration options, you can adjust these to include your specific syntax cases. For instance, you might be able to specify additional patterns or symbols that should be treated as math delimiters.\n\n3. **Custom Plugin**: If the existing plugin doesn't support your needs, you can create a custom plugin. This would involve writing a new plugin that extends `remarkMath` or works alongside it to handle the `$` cases you're interested in.\n\n4. **Testing**: After customizing, thoroughly test your implementation with various examples to ensure it handles the new syntax correctly without breaking existing functionality.\n\n## Example Customization\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might extend `remarkMath` to handle multiple `$` symbols:\n\n```javascript\nconst remark = require('remark');\nconst remarkMath = require('remark-math');\n\n// Custom function to handle multiple $ symbols\nfunction customMathHandler() {\n  return function (tree) {\n    // Modify the tree to handle new syntax cases\n    // This is a placeholder; you would need to implement the actual logic\n  };\n}\n\n// Use remark with the custom handler\nremark()\n  .use(remarkMath)\n  .use(customMathHandler)\n  .processSync('Your Markdown with custom $ syntax').toString();\n```\n\nThis example is very basic and would need to be fleshed out with the actual logic to handle your specific `$` syntax cases.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCustomizing `remarkMath` to handle more syntax cases is definitely possible. It requires a good understanding of the `remark` ecosystem and possibly some JavaScript programming to extend the plugin's capabilities. If you need further assistance with implementation details, feel free to ask.\n\n@EOF@\ncustomization, remarkMath, LaTeX, syntax, parser, JavaScript, plugin, Markdown, math, dollar-sign","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":521,"completion_tokens":512,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1033,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":521,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
