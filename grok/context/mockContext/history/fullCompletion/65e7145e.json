Here's a more in-depth look at the key aspects of Venus, based on previously mentioned information:\n\n### Orbital Characteristics\n\nVenus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles). This orbit takes approximately 224.7 Earth days to complete, making a Venusian year significantly shorter than an Earth year. The orbit of Venus is nearly circular, with an eccentricity of about 0.0068, which is even closer to a perfect circle than Earth's orbit. Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, with a day on Venus (one rotation) taking about 243 Earth days. Remarkably, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the Solar System, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation.\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere of Venus is thick and composed mainly of carbon dioxide (about 96.5%), with nitrogen making up most of the remainder (about 3.5%). The presence of trace amounts of sulfur dioxide and other compounds contributes to the formation of sulfuric acid clouds, which give Venus its characteristic yellowish appearance when viewed from space. The atmospheric pressure at Venus's surface is about 92 times that of Earth's, equivalent to the pressure found about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) below sea level on Earth. This dense atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, leading to surface temperatures that can reach up to 460 degrees Celsius (860 degrees Fahrenheit), making Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System.\n\n### Surface and Geology\n\nVenus's surface is largely covered with volcanic plains, with two large highland areas known as Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra. The surface of Venus is dotted with thousands of volcanoes, some of which are believed to be active. The highest point on Venus is Maxwell Montes, located in Ishtar Terra, reaching an elevation of about 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) above the mean surface level. The surface of Venus is also characterized by extensive lava flows and impact craters. Due to the thick atmosphere, smaller meteoroids burn up before reaching the surface, resulting in fewer craters compared to other rocky planets. The geological activity on Venus is driven by internal heat, which is thought to be similar to Earth's in terms of total heat output, but the lack of plate tectonics results in different expressions of this heat.\n\n### Exploration\n\nVenus has been the target of numerous space missions due to its proximity to Earth and its intriguing characteristics. The first successful flyby was conducted by NASA's Mariner 2 spacecraft in 1962, which confirmed the extreme surface temperatures and the absence of a magnetic field. Subsequent missions, such as the Soviet Venera program, achieved the first successful landings on Venus's surface, returning the first images and data from the planet. More recent missions include the European Space Agency's Venus Express, which orbited Venus from 2006 to 2014, and Japan's Akatsuki, which has been studying Venus's atmosphere since 2015. These missions have provided valuable insights into Venus's atmosphere, surface, and geological activity.\n\n### Future Missions\n\nFuture missions to Venus are planned to further explore its surface and atmosphere. NASA's DAVINCI+ (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) mission, set to launch in the late 2020s, aims to study Venus's atmosphere in detail and drop a probe to the surface. Another mission, VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy), will map Venus's surface to understand its geological history and evolution. These missions will help scientists better understand the processes that have shaped Venus and compare them to those on Earth, potentially providing insights into planetary habitability and the evolution of terrestrial planets.\n\n@EOF@\n[Venus, Earth's sister planet, 224.7 Earth days, retrograde rotation, thick atmosphere, carbon dioxide, sulfuric acid clouds, 92 times Earth's pressure, greenhouse effect, hottest planet, volcanic plains, Maxwell Montes, geological activity, Mariner 2, Venera program, Venus Express, Akatsuki, DAVINCI+, VERITAS, planetary habitability]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1185,"completion_tokens":915,"total_tokens":2100,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1185,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
