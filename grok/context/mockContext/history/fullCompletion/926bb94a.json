They are generally placed at the beginning of the conversation to guide the model's responses throughout the interaction. Here's how system prompts interact with user prompts:\n\n## Placement of System Prompts\n\n- **Typical Use**: System prompts are usually provided before any user prompts to establish the initial context or to set specific rules for the conversation.\n- **After User Prompts**: While it's less common, system prompts can technically be inserted after user prompts in a sequence of API calls. However, this might lead to confusion in the model's understanding of the conversation flow.\n\n## Effects of Positioning\n\n- **Before User Prompts**: When a system prompt is placed at the start, it helps in maintaining a consistent tone or behavior throughout the conversation.\n- **After User Prompts**: If a system prompt is introduced after user prompts, it might cause the model to shift its behavior mid-conversation, which could be disorienting or lead to inconsistent responses.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Consistency**: For clarity and consistency, it's recommended to place system prompts at the beginning of the conversation.\n- **Mid-Conversation Adjustments**: If adjustments to the conversation's direction or tone are needed, it's better to use a user prompt to subtly guide the model rather than introducing a new system prompt.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's how you might structure an API call with system and user prompts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise answers.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can system prompts come after user prompts?\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Typically, system prompts are used at the beginning to set the context for the entire conversation. Placing them after user prompts is less common and may affect the conversation's flow.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the system prompt sets the tone for the entire conversation, and the user prompt follows to ask a specific question.\n\n@EOF@\n[OpenAI, API, system prompts, user prompts, conversation flow, context setting, best practices, consistency, mid-conversation adjustments]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1005,"completion_tokens":468,"total_tokens":1473,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1005,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
