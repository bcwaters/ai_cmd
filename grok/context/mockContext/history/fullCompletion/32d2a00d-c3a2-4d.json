Here are some detailed aspects of this form:\n\n#### Components\n\n- **A and B**: These coefficients represent the slopes of the lines perpendicular to the x and y axes, respectively. They cannot both be zero simultaneously, as that would not define a linear equation.\n- **C**: This constant term represents the point where the line intercepts the line \\(Ax + By = 0\\) if it were extended to intersect the line.\n\n#### Characteristics\n\n- **Intercepts**: The standard form allows for easy calculation of the x-intercept and y-intercept. The x-intercept can be found by setting \\(y = 0\\) and solving for \\(x\\), which gives \\(x = \\frac{C}{A}\\). Similarly, the y-intercept is found by setting \\(x = 0\\) and solving for \\(y\\), which gives \\(y = \\frac{C}{B}\\).\n- **Graphing**: To graph a line in standard form, you can find two points using the intercepts and then draw a straight line through them. Alternatively, you can solve for \\(y\\) to convert it to slope-intercept form for easier graphing.\n\n#### Uses\n\n- **Solving Systems of Equations**: The standard form is particularly useful when solving systems of linear equations. Techniques like substitution or elimination can be applied directly to equations in this form.\n- **Real-World Applications**: This form can be used in various scenarios, such as budgeting (where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might represent different types of expenses), or in physics (where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might represent position and time).\n\n#### Examples\n\n- **Budgeting Example**: Suppose you have a budget where you can spend up to $600 on food (\\(x\\)) and entertainment (\\(y\\)). If food costs $2 per unit and entertainment costs $3 per unit, the equation becomes \\(2x + 3y = 600\\).\n- **Physics Example**: In a physics problem, if an object's position \\(y\\) as a function of time \\(x\\) is given by \\(2x + 3y = 6\\), you can use this equation to determine the position at any given time.\n\nBy understanding the standard form of a linear equation, you can manipulate and apply it in various mathematical contexts and real-world situations, making it a fundamental tool in algebra and beyond.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":705,"completion_tokens":538,"total_tokens":1243,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":705,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
