The general form of a quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\]\n\nHere, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants, and \\(x\\) is the variable. The coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) can be any real numbers, but \\(a\\) cannot be zero, otherwise, the equation would not be quadratic but linear.\n\n#### Structure and Examples\nThe structure of a quadratic equation allows for various forms and representations. An example of a quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \\]\n\nIn this example, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = 6\\). Another example could be:\n\n\\[ 2x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 3\\), and \\(c = -4\\).\n\n#### Solving Quadratic Equations\nThere are several methods to solve quadratic equations:\n\n1. **Factoring**: This method involves rewriting the quadratic equation as a product of two binomials. For the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\), it can be factored as:\n\n   \\[ (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \\]\n\n   Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula**: The quadratic formula provides a direct way to find the solutions of any quadratic equation. It is given by:\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\n   Using the quadratic formula on \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\), we get:\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6}}{2 \\cdot 1} \\]\n   \\[ x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} \\]\n   \\[ x = \\frac{5 \\pm 1}{2} \\]\n\n   This results in the solutions \\(x = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\).\n\n3. **Completing the Square**: This method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial. For the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\), we can complete the square as follows:\n\n   \\[ x^2 - 5x = -6 \\]\n   \\[ x^2 - 5x + \\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^2 = -6 + \\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n   \\[ x^2 - 5x + \\frac{25}{4} = -6 + \\frac{25}{4} \\]\n   \\[ \\left(x - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{-24 + 25}{4} \\]\n   \\[ \\left(x - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\n   Taking the square root of both sides:\n\n   \\[ x - \\frac{5}{2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n   Solving for \\(x\\):\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 3 \\]\n   \\[ x = \\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\]\n\n#### Applications\nQuadratic equations are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. For example, they can model the path of a projectile, the growth of a population, or the profit of a business.\n\n#### Graphical Representation\nThe graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola. The direction and shape of the parabola depend on the value of \\(a\\). If \\(a > 0\\), the parabola opens upwards, and if \\(a < 0\\), it opens downwards. The vertex of the parabola, which is the minimum or maximum point, can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\]\n\nFor the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\), the vertex is at:\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{-5}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 2.5\\) back into the equation to find the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n\\[ y = (2.5)^2 - 5 \\cdot 2.5 + 6 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 6 = -0.25 \\]\n\nThus, the vertex is at \\((2.5, -0.25)\\).\n\nIn summary, quadratic equations are versatile and essential in mathematics, offering multiple methods for solution and broad applications in real-world scenarios. @EOF@[Quadratic Equation, Structure and Examples, Solving Quadratic Equations, Factoring, Quadratic Formula, Completing the Square, Applications, Graphical Representation]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":585,"completion_tokens":1102,"total_tokens":1687,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":585,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
