It is a part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, which is widely used and continuously updated by the community and Google. TensorFlow.js specifically focuses on enabling machine learning in JavaScript environments, which is crucial for web-based applications.\n\nRegarding xAI's use of TensorFlow.js for its consumer-facing social media platform, there is no public information available that confirms or denies this. xAI's focus has been more on scientific discovery and AI research rather than consumer-facing social media platforms. Therefore, it is unlikely that xAI uses TensorFlow.js for such purposes, but without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.\n\n@EOF@\n[TensorFlow.js, actively maintained, xAI, consumer-facing, social media, machine learning, JavaScript, web applications]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":820,"completion_tokens":162,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":982,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":820,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
