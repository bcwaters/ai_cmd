You can list all your images with the command:\n   ```bash\n   docker images\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the Dockerfile**: Open your Dockerfile and ensure it uses the existing image as its base. For example, if your existing image is named `myapp:oldversion`, your Dockerfile might start with:\n   ```Dockerfile\n   FROM myapp:oldversion\n   ```\n\n3. **Rebuild the Image**: Use the `docker build` command to rebuild the Docker image. Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t myapp:newversion .\n   ```\n   This command tells Docker to build a new image with the tag `myapp:newversion` using the instructions in the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).\n\n4. **Verify the New Image**: After the build process completes, verify that the new image has been created:\n   ```bash\n   docker images\n   ```\n   You should see `myapp:newversion` listed.\n\n5. **Run the New Image**: If you want to run a container from the new image, use:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -it myapp:newversion\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively rebuild a Docker image using an old image as the base, incorporating any new changes or updates specified in your Dockerfile.\n\n@EOF@\nDocker, Rebuild, ExistingImage, Dockerfile, BuildCommand, VerifyImage, RunContainer","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":932,"completion_tokens":340,"total_tokens":1272,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":932,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
