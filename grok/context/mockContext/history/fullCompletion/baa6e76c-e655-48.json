It can be used for AI-generated image detection after fine-tuning. To use MobileNet in TensorFlow.js, you would load the model, preprocess the input images, and then use the model for prediction.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Load the pretrained MobileNet model\n   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/mobilenet/model.json');\n\n   // Preprocess the image\n   const imageTensor = preprocessImage(image);\n\n   // Make a prediction\n   const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);\n\n   // Interpret the prediction\n   const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();\n   const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5;\n\n   console.log('Is AI-generated:', isAI);\n   ```\n\n2. **ResNet**\n   ResNet (Residual Network) models like ResNet50 or ResNet100 are popular for image classification tasks. They can be fine-tuned for detecting AI-generated images. In TensorFlow.js, you would follow a similar process as with MobileNet to load, preprocess, and predict.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Load the pretrained ResNet model\n   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/resnet/model.json');\n\n   // Preprocess the image\n   const imageTensor = preprocessImage(image);\n\n   // Make a prediction\n   const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);\n\n   // Interpret the prediction\n   const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();\n   const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5;\n\n   console.log('Is AI-generated:', isAI);\n   ```\n\n3. **EfficientNet**\n   EfficientNet, developed by Google, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being efficient in terms of parameters and FLOPs. These models can be fine-tuned for AI-generated image detection. The process to use EfficientNet in TensorFlow.js is similar to the other models.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Load the pretrained EfficientNet model\n   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/efficientnet/model.json');\n\n   // Preprocess the image\n   const imageTensor = preprocessImage(image);\n\n   // Make a prediction\n   const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);\n\n   // Interpret the prediction\n   const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();\n   const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5;\n\n   console.log('Is AI-generated:', isAI);\n   ```\n\nThese models can be loaded and used in TensorFlow.js to detect AI-generated images by following the example code provided above.@EOF@MobileNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, TensorFlow.js, AI image classification","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":832,"completion_tokens":557,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":1389,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":832,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
