In this specific equation, \\( y = 2x + 3 \\):\n\n- **\\( m \\) (slope):** The coefficient of \\( x \\), which is 2, indicates the slope of the line. The slope describes how steep the line is and in which direction it is going. A positive slope of 2 means that for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) increases by 2 units.\n- **\\( b \\) (y-intercept):** The constant term, which is 3, represents the y-intercept. This is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, specifically at the point \\((0, 3)\\).\n\n### Graphical Interpretation\n\nWhen graphing \\( y = 2x + 3 \\):\n\n- **Starting Point:** The line starts at the y-intercept, which is at \\( y = 3 \\) when \\( x = 0 \\).\n- **Direction and Steepness:** The line will move upwards to the right because the slope is positive. The steepness is determined by the slope of 2, meaning the line will rise 2 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right.\n- **Example Points:** To plot additional points, you can choose values of \\( x \\) and calculate \\( y \\):\n  - If \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \\). So, another point on the line is \\((1, 5)\\).\n  - If \\( x = -1 \\), then \\( y = 2(-1) + 3 = 1 \\). So, another point on the line is \\((-1, 1)\\).\n\n### Mathematical Properties\n\n- **Linearity:** The equation is linear because the highest power of \\( x \\) is 1. This means the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is constant and does not change as \\( x \\) changes.\n- **Infinite Solutions:** A linear equation like \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) has an infinite number of solutions, each corresponding to a point on the line.\n- **Parallel Lines:** If another line has the same slope (2) but a different y-intercept, it will be parallel to \\( y = 2x + 3 \\). For example, \\( y = 2x + 5 \\) is parallel to \\( y = 2x + 3 \\).\n\n### Applications\n\nLinear equations like \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) are widely used in various fields:\n\n- **Economics:** They can represent cost functions or demand curves where \\( x \\) could be the quantity of goods and \\( y \\) the total cost or revenue.\n- **Physics:** They can describe motion with constant velocity, where \\( x \\) is time and \\( y \\) is distance.\n- **Engineering:** They are used in modeling relationships between variables, such as the relationship between force and acceleration.\n\n### Solving for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) given a value of \\( y \\), you can rearrange the equation:\n\n- If \\( y = 7 \\), then \\( 7 = 2x + 3 \\). Solving for \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  7 - 3 = 2x \\implies 4 = 2x \\implies x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n  \\]\n  So, when \\( y = 7 \\), \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( y \\) given a value of \\( x \\), you simply substitute \\( x \\) into the equation:\n\n- If \\( x = 4 \\), then \\( y = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \\). So, when \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 11 \\).\n\nIn summary, the linear equation \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) is a fundamental representation of a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3, providing a clear and constant relationship between the variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n@EOF@[Linear Equation, slope, y-intercept, graphical interpretation, mathematical properties, applications, solving equations]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1098,"completion_tokens":908,"reasoning_tokens":0,"total_tokens":2006,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1098,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
