Key steps include:\n\n- **Model Selection**: Choose a model like BERT or other transformer-based models that excel at capturing semantic relationships. These models can be fine-tuned on your specific dataset if necessary.\n- **Embedding Use**: Use the selected model to generate embeddings for each entry. These embeddings should capture the semantic essence of the text.\n\n## Data Preprocessing\n\n**Data Preprocessing** is crucial for preparing your data to be loaded into a vector database, enhancing semantic understanding. Key steps include:\n\n- **Text Preprocessing**: Apply techniques such as lowercasing, removing special characters, punctuation, and numbers, as well as handling stopwords, stemming, lemmatization, and negation handling. This reduces noise and focuses on the semantic content of the data.\n- **Standardization**: Ensure that your data is in a consistent format to improve the model's ability to generalize and process it accurately.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively prepare your data for semantic search and retrieval using a vector database.\n\n@EOF@[Embedding Generation, Data Preprocessing]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":995,"completion_tokens":237,"total_tokens":1232,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":995,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
