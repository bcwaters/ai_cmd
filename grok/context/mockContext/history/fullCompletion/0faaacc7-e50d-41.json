This results in a parabolic curve when graphed, which can either open upwards (if \\(a > 0\\)) or downwards (if \\(a < 0\\)).\n\n#### **Solving the Equation:**\nThere are several methods to solve a quadratic equation, each with its own advantages depending on the nature of the coefficients and the specific problem at hand:\n\n1. **Factoring:**\n   If the quadratic can be factored into the form \\((px + q)(rx + s) = 0\\), then \\(x\\) can be found by setting each factor equal to zero. This method is straightforward but not always possible.\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula:**\n   The most universal method to solve a quadratic equation is using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Here, the term under the square root, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), is known as the discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)). The value of the discriminant determines the nature of the roots:\n   - If \\(\\Delta > 0\\), there are two distinct real roots.\n   - If \\(\\Delta = 0\\), there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n   - If \\(\\Delta < 0\\), there are two complex roots.\n\n3. **Completing the Square:**\n   This method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial. It's particularly useful when the quadratic formula isn't immediately applicable or for understanding the geometric interpretation of the quadratic equation.\n\n#### **Applications:**\nQuadratic equations are widely used in various fields:\n- **Physics:** To describe the motion of objects under the influence of gravity (e.g., projectile motion).\n- **Economics:** In models that involve optimization, such as profit maximization or cost minimization.\n- **Engineering:** For designing structures or analyzing systems where variables interact quadratically.\n\n#### **Graphical Representation:**\nWhen plotted on a graph, a quadratic equation forms a parabola. The vertex of the parabola represents the maximum or minimum value of the function, depending on the direction the parabola opens. The \\(x\\)-intercepts (if they exist) are the solutions to the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n#### **Real-World Example:**\nConsider a scenario where a ball is thrown upwards. The height \\(h\\) of the ball at time \\(t\\) can be modeled by a quadratic equation:\n\\[\nh = -16t^2 + vt + h_0\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the initial velocity, \\(h_0\\) is the initial height, and \\(-16\\) is the acceleration due to gravity in feet per second squared. Solving this equation helps determine when and where the ball will hit the ground or reach its maximum height.\n\n@EOF@[Quadratic Equation, Nature of Equation, Solving Methods, Factoring, Quadratic Formula, Discriminant, Completing the Square, Applications, Physics, Economics, Engineering, Graphical Representation, Parabola, Vertex, Real-World Example, Projectile Motion]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":479,"completion_tokens":722,"total_tokens":1201,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":479,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
