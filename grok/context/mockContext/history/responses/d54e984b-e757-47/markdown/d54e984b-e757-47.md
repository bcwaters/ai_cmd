### JavaScript Data Structures

In JavaScript, data structures are essential for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Here are three commonly used data structures in JavaScript:

1. **Arrays**
   - **Description**: Arrays are ordered lists of values. They can contain elements of any type, including other arrays and objects.
   - **Usage**: Useful for storing and manipulating collections of data where the order matters.
   - **Example**: `let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];`

2. **Objects**
   - **Description**: Objects are collections of key-value pairs. They are similar to associative arrays or dictionaries in other languages.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for representing structured data that needs to be accessed by named properties.
   - **Example**: `let person = {name: 'John', age: 30};`

3. **Maps**
   - **Description**: Maps are collections of keyed data items, just like objects, but keys can be of any type.
   - **Usage**: Useful when you need keys that can't be used as object properties (like objects or functions) or when you need to preserve the insertion order of keys.
   - **Example**: `let map = new Map(); map.set('key1', 'value1');`

Would you like to know more about any of these data structures or perhaps how to use them in specific scenarios?
