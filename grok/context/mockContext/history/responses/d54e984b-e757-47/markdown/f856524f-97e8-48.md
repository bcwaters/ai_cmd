### Objects in JavaScript

**Description**: Objects in JavaScript are fundamental data structures that store collections of key-value pairs. These pairs are often referred to as properties, where the key is the property name and the value can be any JavaScript data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, or even other objects.

**Usage**: Objects are incredibly versatile and are used for a wide range of purposes in JavaScript programming:
- **Data Modeling**: Objects are used to model real-world entities. For example, a `person` object can represent a person with properties like `name`, `age`, and `address`.
- **State Management**: In applications, objects can be used to manage the state of the application, where different properties represent different states or data points.
- **Method Storage**: Objects can also contain functions as values, which are then called methods. These methods can operate on the object's data or perform actions related to the object.

**Structure and Syntax**:
- Objects are defined using curly braces `{}`. Inside these braces, you list the key-value pairs separated by commas.
- Keys are strings or symbols, but when they are valid JavaScript identifiers, they can be used without quotes.
- Values can be of any type.

**Example**:
```javascript
let car = {
    make: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Corolla',
    year: 2020,
    isElectric: false,
    startEngine: function() {
        console.log('Engine started!');
    }
};
```

**Accessing Properties**:
- **Dot Notation**: `car.make` returns 'Toyota'.
- **Bracket Notation**: `car['model']` returns 'Corolla'. This is useful when the property name is determined at runtime or contains characters that are not valid in identifiers.

**Manipulating Objects**:
- **Adding Properties**: `car.color = 'Blue';` adds a new property `color` with the value 'Blue'.
- **Updating Properties**: `car.year = 2021;` updates the `year` property to 2021.
- **Deleting Properties**: `delete car.isElectric;` removes the `isElectric` property from the object.

**Nested Objects**: Objects can contain other objects, allowing for complex data structures. For example:
```javascript
let library = {
    name: 'Central Library',
    books: {
        fiction: ['1984', 'Brave New World'],
        nonFiction: ['A Brief History of Time']
    }
};
```

**Object Methods**: Objects can include methods, which are functions stored as properties:
```javascript
let calculator = {
    add: function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    },
    subtract: function(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    }
};
```

**Iterating Over Objects**: You can iterate over the keys of an object using `for...in` loop or `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` methods:
```javascript
for (let key in car) {
    console.log(key + ": " + car[key]);
}
```

Objects in JavaScript are powerful and flexible, making them a cornerstone of JavaScript programming for organizing and manipulating data.
