### Maps in JavaScript

**Maps** are a powerful data structure in JavaScript, designed to hold key-value pairs where both keys and values can be of any type. This flexibility sets them apart from objects, which can only have strings or symbols as keys.

#### Detailed Description
- **Key Types**: Unlike objects, Maps can use any value as a key, including objects, functions, and any other primitive types. This is particularly useful when you need to use complex objects as keys.
- **Order Preservation**: Maps maintain the insertion order of the keys. This means that when you iterate over a Map, the key-value pairs are returned in the order they were inserted.
- **Size Property**: Maps have a `size` property that returns the number of key-value pairs in the Map, making it easy to check the Map's length.

#### Usage Scenarios
- **Dynamic Key-Value Storage**: When you need a collection where keys can be of any type and you need to frequently add or remove entries.
- **Preserving Order**: When the order in which data was added matters, such as in a history log or a queue system.
- **Avoiding Key Collisions**: When using objects as keys in an object would lead to key collisions or loss of data due to how JavaScript handles object equality.

#### Example with Detailed Explanation
```javascript
let map = new Map();

// Adding entries to the Map
map.set('key1', 'value1'); // Adding a string key
map.set(42, 'answer'); // Adding a number key
map.set({ name: 'John' }, 'person'); // Adding an object key

// Accessing values
console.log(map.get('key1')); // Output: value1
console.log(map.get(42)); // Output: answer
console.log(map.get({ name: 'John' })); // Output: undefined, because object keys are compared by reference

// Checking size
console.log(map.size); // Output: 3

// Iterating over the Map
for (let [key, value] of map) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
// Output:
// key1 value1
// 42 answer
// [object Object] person

// Deleting an entry
map.delete(42);
console.log(map.size); // Output: 2
```

#### Additional Features
- **Methods**: Maps come with several useful methods like `clear()` to remove all key-value pairs, `has(key)` to check if a key exists, and `keys()`, `values()`, and `entries()` for iteration.
- **Performance**: In general, Maps are optimized for frequent additions and deletions, making them more efficient than objects for these operations in many scenarios.
