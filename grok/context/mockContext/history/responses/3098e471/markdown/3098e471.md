# Managing Node Visibility in Pure HTML

When dealing with node visibility in pure HTML, you have two primary options: using the `hidden` attribute or manipulating the DOM with `append`/`remove` methods. Let's evaluate both approaches:

## Using the `hidden` Attribute

The `hidden` attribute is a straightforward way to control the visibility of an element. When the attribute is present, the element is hidden from view but remains in the DOM.

**Pros:**
- **Simplicity:** It's easy to toggle visibility with JavaScript by adding or removing the `hidden` attribute.
- **Performance:** Since the element remains in the DOM, toggling visibility is generally faster than removing and re-adding elements.

**Cons:**
- **Accessibility:** Some screen readers might ignore hidden elements, which could impact accessibility.

**Example:**
```html
<div id="myElement" hidden>This is hidden</div>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('myElement').hidden = false; // Show the element
document.getElementById('myElement').hidden = true;  // Hide the element
```

## Using `append` and `remove` Methods

Alternatively, you can manage visibility by appending and removing elements from the DOM. This approach involves physically adding or removing nodes from the DOM structure.

**Pros:**
- **Memory Management:** Removing elements can help manage memory, especially if the elements contain large amounts of data.
- **Dynamic Content:** It's useful when you need to dynamically add or remove content based on user interactions or data changes.

**Cons:**
- **Performance:** Removing and re-adding elements can be more resource-intensive than simply toggling visibility.
- **Complexity:** It requires more code to manage the state of the DOM and can lead to more complex logic.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Initial state with no element -->
```

```javascript
// Create the element
const element = document.createElement('div');
element.textContent = 'This is dynamic content';

// Append the element to show it
document.body.appendChild(element);

// Remove the element to hide it
document.body.removeChild(element);
```

## Recommendation

For managing node visibility in pure HTML, **using the `hidden` attribute** is generally the better approach. It offers simplicity and better performance for toggling visibility. However, if you need to completely remove elements from the DOM for memory management or to handle dynamic content, using `append` and `remove` methods might be more appropriate.

**Considerations:**
- **Use Case:** If your application requires frequent toggling of visibility, `hidden` is preferred. For scenarios where elements need to be dynamically added or removed, consider using `append`/`remove`.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that the use of `hidden` does not negatively impact your application's accessibility.

In conclusion, choose the method that best aligns with your specific needs and performance requirements.
