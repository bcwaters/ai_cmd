# Git Status Command

The `git status` command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Here's a brief overview of what you might see when you run this command:

- **Untracked files:** Files in your working directory that are not yet tracked by Git.
- **Changes to be committed:** Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.
- **Changes not staged for commit:** Files that have been modified but not yet added to the staging area.

To use the command, simply type:

```bash
git status
```

This command is essential for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits or pushing changes.
