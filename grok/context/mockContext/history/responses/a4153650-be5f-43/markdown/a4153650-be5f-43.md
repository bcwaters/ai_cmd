# Testing the `grep` Command in Bash

The `grep` command is a powerful tool for searching text within files using regular expressions. Below, we'll explore how to use `grep` with various flags and options, especially in the context of searching multiple files recursively, and displaying line numbers.

## Basic Usage of `grep`

To search for a pattern within a file, you can use `grep` in the following way:

```bash
grep "search_pattern" filename.txt
```

## Using `grep` with Flags

### Case-Insensitive Search

To perform a case-insensitive search, use the `-i` flag:

```bash
grep -i "search_pattern" filename.txt
```

### Recursive Search

To search within multiple files in a directory and its subdirectories, use the `-r` flag:

```bash
grep -r "search_pattern" /path/to/directory
```

### Display Line Numbers

To display the line numbers of matches, use the `-n` flag:

```bash
grep -n "search_pattern" filename.txt
```

## Combining Flags

You can combine multiple flags to enhance your search capabilities. For example, to perform a case-insensitive, recursive search with line numbers:

```bash
grep -rin "search_pattern" /path/to/directory
```

## Sequential Commands

To run multiple commands sequentially, you can use the `&&` operator. Here's an example of searching for a pattern in multiple files and then processing the results:

```bash
grep -rin "search_pattern" /path/to/directory && echo "Search completed"
```

## Example with Multiple Files and Line Numbers

If you want to search for a pattern across multiple files and show the line numbers, you could do:

```bash
grep -n "search_pattern" file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

## Additional Flags

There are many additional flags that can be used with `grep`. Here's an example using `-A` to show lines after a match:

```bash
grep -A 2 "search_pattern" filename.txt
```

This will show the line containing the match and the two lines following it.

## Confirmation and Sequence

To confirm that you've run the commands successfully, you can add an echo statement at the end of your sequence:

```bash
grep -rin "search_pattern" /path/to/directory && echo "Search completed successfully"
```
