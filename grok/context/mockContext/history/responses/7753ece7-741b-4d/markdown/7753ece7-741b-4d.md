To list files by their creation date in Bash, you can use the `ls` command combined with the `stat` command to sort the files. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
ls -l --time=creation --sort=time
```

This command will list the files in the current directory sorted by creation time. Note that the `--time=creation` option might not be supported on all systems. If your system does not support it, you can use the following alternative:

```bash
stat -c "%w %n" * | sort -n
```

This command uses `stat` to get the creation time (`%w`) and filename (`%n`), then pipes the output to `sort` to sort numerically by the timestamp.

If you want to see the output in a more traditional `ls -l` format, you can combine `ls` with `stat` and `sort`:

```bash
for f in *; do
  echo "$(stat -c "%w" "$f") $f"
done | sort -n | while read -r line; do
  file=$(echo "$line" | cut -d' ' -f2-)
  ls -ld "$file"
done
```

This script will list the files in a long format (`-l`) sorted by creation time.
