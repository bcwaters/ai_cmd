# GrokRuntime Analysis

## Runtime

The script provided consists of variable assignments for ANSI color codes, which do not execute any operations at runtime. Therefore, the runtime of this script itself is effectively zero, as it only sets up variables for later use.

If you're inquiring about the runtime environment where these color codes would be utilized, it would typically be within a terminal or command-line interface (CLI) on Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux. The color codes are compatible with terminals that support ANSI escape sequences.

## Banner

The script does not contain an explicit banner. However, if you're considering using these color codes to create a banner in a terminal, you could use the variables to style text in various colors. Here's an example of how you might create a simple banner:

```bash
echo -e "${color_blue_light}======================================${color_reset}"
echo -e "${color_blue_light}Welcome to my terminal${color_reset}"
echo -e "${color_blue_light}======================================${color_reset}"
```

This would output a banner with light blue borders and the text "Welcome to my terminal" in the default terminal color.

If you intended to include a banner in your script, you would need to add such lines or a more elaborate script to display it.

## GrokRuntime

The term "Grokruntime" is not defined in the provided script or common in the context of ANSI color codes. It might be a custom term or a misunderstanding. If you meant to ask about the runtime environment where these color codes would be used, please refer to the "Runtime" section above. If "Grokruntime" refers to a specific framework or environment, please provide more details for a more accurate analysis.
