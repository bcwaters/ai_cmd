# Open Source Machine Learning Libraries for Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to open source machine learning libraries, here are several notable options that are widely used and actively maintained:

1. **TensorFlow**
   - **Description**: Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is a comprehensive open source platform for machine learning. It has a large community and is used in research and production environments.
   - **Contribution Areas**: Model optimization, new model architectures, documentation, and example projects.
   - **Link**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

2. **PyTorch**
   - **Description**: Created by Meta AI, PyTorch is known for its ease of use and dynamic computational graph. It's popular in both academic and industry settings.
   - **Contribution Areas**: New features, performance improvements, and tutorials.
   - **Link**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

3. **scikit-learn**
   - **Description**: A machine learning library for the Python programming language, it features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
   - **Contribution Areas**: New algorithms, performance enhancements, and educational resources.
   - **Link**: [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

4. **Keras**
   - **Description**: An API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load and can run on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano.
   - **Contribution Areas**: New layers, model architectures, and usability improvements.
   - **Link**: [Keras](https://keras.io/)

5. **Hugging Face Transformers**
   - **Description**: A library that provides state-of-the-art machine learning models for natural language processing (NLP).
   - **Contribution Areas**: New models, model fine-tuning, and integration with other libraries.
   - **Link**: [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)

6. **Apache MXNet**
   - **Description**: A deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility, it allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity.
   - **Contribution Areas**: New operators, performance optimizations, and documentation.
   - **Link**: [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/)

7. **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**
   - **Description**: An open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them.
   - **Contribution Areas**: New converter tools, model optimizations, and documentation.
   - **Link**: [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/)

When choosing a library to contribute to, consider your interests, the community's needs, and your skill set. Engaging with the community through forums, GitHub issues, and contributing to documentation can be a great way to start.
