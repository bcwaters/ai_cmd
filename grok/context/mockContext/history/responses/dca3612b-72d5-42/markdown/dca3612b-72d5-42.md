# Alternative LaTeX Syntax Packages for remark

If you're looking for packages similar to `remark-math` but designed to handle other LaTeX syntax, there are a few options you might consider:

- **remark-math** itself is quite versatile and can handle a wide range of LaTeX syntax for inline and display math. However, if you need specialized handling:

- **remark-katex**: This plugin uses KaTeX, a fast LaTeX renderer, which supports a broad subset of LaTeX. It's particularly good for rendering math on the web due to its speed.

- **remark-mathjax**: This uses MathJax, another popular LaTeX renderer, which supports a larger subset of LaTeX syntax compared to KaTeX. It's more suitable if you need advanced LaTeX features.

- **remark-rehype**: While not specifically for LaTeX, it converts Markdown to HTML, and when combined with rehype-katex or rehype-mathjax, it can render LaTeX math in HTML.

Each of these options can be integrated into a Markdown processing pipeline to handle LaTeX syntax beyond what `remark-math` might cover, depending on your specific needs.
