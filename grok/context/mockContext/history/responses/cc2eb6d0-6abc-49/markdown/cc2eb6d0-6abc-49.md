Here are several inline LaTeX equations for testing an math parser:

- The Pythagorean theorem is given by $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
- The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
- The area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$.
- The volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
- The slope of a line is $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
- Euler's identity is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.
- The binomial theorem states $(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$.
- The derivative of $f(x) = x^n$ is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.
- The integral of $f(x) = x^n$ is $\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ for $n 
eq -1$.
- The limit definition of a derivative is $f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$.
