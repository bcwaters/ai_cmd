## Jest Features

1. **Snapshot Testing**
   - Allows you to capture the rendered output of a component and compare it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. This is particularly useful for ensuring UI components don't unexpectedly change.

2. **Mock Functions**
   - Jest provides a robust way to mock functions, which is essential for isolating the code you're testing. You can use `jest.fn()` to create mock functions and track calls, arguments, and return values.
