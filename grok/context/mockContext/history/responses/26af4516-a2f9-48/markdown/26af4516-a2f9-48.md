Here are some LaTeX equations related to summations, softmax, and Pythagoras:

### Summation

The summation notation is a powerful tool in mathematics and is often used to represent a series or a sum of elements. The general form of a summation can be written as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i
$$

This represents the sum of the elements \(a_i\) from \(i=1\) to \(i=n\).

### Softmax Function

The softmax function is widely used in machine learning, particularly in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification. It is defined as:

$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}}
$$

Here, \(z_i\) is the input to the output layer, and \(k\) is the number of classes.

### Pythagoras' Theorem

Pythagoras' theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. It is expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs of the triangle, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.

These equations illustrate the use of LaTeX to represent mathematical concepts clearly and precisely.
