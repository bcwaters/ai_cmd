### Where is a Docker Image Stored?

Docker images are stored in a Docker registry. The most commonly used public registry is Docker Hub, but you can also use private registries like those provided by Docker, Google Cloud, or AWS. Locally, Docker images are stored in the Docker daemon's storage directory, which varies depending on your operating system:
- **Linux**: `/var/lib/docker/`
- **macOS/Windows (Docker Desktop)**: The exact path can be found in Docker Desktop settings, typically under `Resources > Advanced > Disk image location`.

### How to View a List of Docker Images?

To view a list of Docker images on your local machine, you can use the Docker CLI. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
docker images
```

This command lists all the Docker images that are currently stored on your local machine, showing details such as the image ID, creation date, and size.

### Additional Notes

- **Tagging Images**: When you build or pull an image, you can tag it with a specific name and version. For example:
  ```bash
  docker build -t myapp:v1 .
  ```
  This command builds an image and tags it as `myapp` with version `v1`.

- **Pushing Images**: To push an image to a registry, you need to tag it with the registry's URL and then push it:
  ```bash
  docker tag myapp:v1 myregistry.com/myapp:v1
  docker push myregistry.com/myapp:v1
  ```

- **Inspecting Images**: To get detailed information about an image, you can use:
  ```bash
  docker inspect <image_id_or_name>
  ```

For more advanced management and troubleshooting, refer to Docker's official documentation.
