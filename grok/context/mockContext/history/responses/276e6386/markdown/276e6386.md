# No, the `ubuntulatest` base image does not come with Node.js and npm pre-installed. If you need Node.js and npm in your Docker container, you will have to install them manually in your Dockerfile.

Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile to include Node.js and npm:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install necessary tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git

# Install Node.js and npm
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs npm

# Clone your repository
RUN git clone <your-repo-url> /app

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the .env file into the container if using during build
# COPY .env .env

# Specify the command to run on container start
CMD ["bash"]
```

With these additions, your Docker container will have Node.js and npm installed, allowing you to run Node.js applications.
