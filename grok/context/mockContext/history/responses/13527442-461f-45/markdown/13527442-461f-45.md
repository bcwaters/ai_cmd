# Current Context Review

The current context provided is about stopping a Node.js service that was started in the background using the command line interface. Here is the detailed context:

## Steps to Stop a Node.js Service Running in the Background

### Step 1: Find the Process ID (PID)

To stop a Node.js service, you first need to identify the Process ID (PID) of the service. You can do this by using the `ps` command in your terminal.

```bash
ps aux | grep node
```

This command lists all processes that match the keyword "node". The output will look something like this:

```
user  12345  0.0  1.2  345678  123456 ?        S    12:34   0:01 /usr/bin/node server.js
```

The second column (`12345` in this example) is the PID of the Node.js process.

### Step 2: Kill the Process

Once you have the PID, you can stop the Node.js service using the `kill` command.

```bash
kill -9 12345
```

Replace `12345` with the actual PID you found. The `-9` flag sends a SIGKILL signal, which forces the process to terminate immediately.

### Alternative Method: Using `pkill`

If you prefer a more straightforward approach, you can use `pkill` to stop all Node.js processes.

```bash
pkill node
```

This command will send a SIGTERM signal to all processes named "node", which should stop them gracefully. If you need to force termination, you can use:

```bash
pkill -9 node
```

### Summary

- Find the PID: Use `ps aux | grep node`.
- Kill the process: Use `kill -9 <PID>` or `pkill node`.

By following these steps, you should be able to stop your Node.js service running in the background.
