# Building a Docker Image

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you use the `docker build` command. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> <path-to-dockerfile>
```

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `-t` specifies the name and optionally a tag in the `name:tag` format for the resulting image.
- `<image-name>` is the name you want to give your Docker image.
- `<tag>` is an optional tag, which defaults to `latest` if not specified.
- `<path-to-dockerfile>` is the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile. If the Dockerfile is in the current directory, you can use `.`.

### Example

If your Dockerfile is in the current directory and you want to name the image `myapp` with the tag `v1.0`, you would run:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1.0 .
```

This command builds the Docker image based on the instructions in your Dockerfile and tags it as `myapp:v1.0`.
