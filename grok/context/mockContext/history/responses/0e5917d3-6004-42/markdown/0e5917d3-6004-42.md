# Testing Remark-Highlight.js Integration

If you're looking to enhance your Markdown documents with syntax highlighting for code blocks, integrating `remark-highlight.js` into your project is a great approach. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Installation

To install `remark-highlight.js`, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install remark-highlight.js
```

This command will add the `remark-highlight.js` package to your project, enabling you to use syntax highlighting when processing Markdown files.

### Step 2: Integration

After installation, you need to integrate `remark-highlight.js` into your unified pipeline. This is crucial for enabling syntax highlighting in your Markdown-to-HTML conversion process. Here's a basic example of how you might set up your pipeline:

```javascript
const unified = require('unified');
const markdown = require('remark-parse');
const remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype');
const html = require('rehype-stringify');
const highlight = require('remark-highlight.js');

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(highlight)
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(html)
  .processSync('```js
console.log("Hello, World!")
```')
  .toString();
```

In this setup, `remark-highlight.js` is used to process code blocks and apply syntax highlighting before converting the Markdown to HTML.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Readability**: Syntax highlighting makes code blocks in your Markdown documents more readable and professional.
- **Improved Documentation**: Useful for creating detailed technical documentation where code examples are common.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used in various static site generators and other Markdown processing tools that support the unified ecosystem.

By following these steps, you can effectively use `remark-highlight.js` to improve the presentation of code in your Markdown files.
