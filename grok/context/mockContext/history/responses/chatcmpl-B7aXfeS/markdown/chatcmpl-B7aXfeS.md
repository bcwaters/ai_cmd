Certainly! Here's a simplified version of the U.S. map using ASCII art, starting with Maine in the top left corner. Due to the constraints of ASCII characters, the depiction is simplified and might not be precisely to scale, but provides a recognizable outline of the United States map:

This depiction, while approximate due to the constraints of ASCII art, visually connects the states together like a map. Let me know if you need any changes.
