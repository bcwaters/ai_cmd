# LLM Architectures

Here are three different architectures commonly used in Large Language Models (LLMs):

## 1. **Transformer Architecture**

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has become the foundation for many modern LLMs. Key features include:

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence.
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Typically used in tasks like translation, where the encoder processes the input and the decoder generates the output.
- **Parallel Processing**: Enables efficient training on large datasets due to its ability to process input sequences in parallel.

Example models: BERT, GPT, T5.

## 2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Architecture**

RNNs were one of the earliest architectures used for sequence modeling. Key features include:

- **Sequential Processing**: Processes input data sequentially, maintaining an internal state (memory) that captures information about previous inputs.
- **Variants**: Includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs.
- **Applications**: Suitable for tasks like time series prediction, speech recognition, and text generation.

Example models: Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU.

## 3. **Sparse Transformer Architecture**

Sparse Transformers aim to improve the efficiency of traditional Transformers by reducing computational complexity. Key features include:

- **Sparse Attention Patterns**: Instead of attending to all positions in the input sequence, the model attends to a subset, reducing the computational load.
- **Scalability**: Allows for processing longer sequences and larger models with less memory and computational resources.
- **Applications**: Useful in scenarios where efficiency is critical, such as real-time processing or handling very large datasets.

Example models: Sparse Transformer, Reformer, Longformer.
