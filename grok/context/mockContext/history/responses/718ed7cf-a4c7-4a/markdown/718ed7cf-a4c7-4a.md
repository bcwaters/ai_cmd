To use Express to view only the return value and suppress logs, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup Express Server**: First, ensure you have Express installed and set up your basic server.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

2. **Suppress Console Logs**: To suppress console logs, you can override the `console.log` method or use a logging library that can be configured to not output to console. Here's how you can override `console.log`:

   ```javascript
   console.log = () => {};
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're using a logging library like `morgan`, you can configure it to not log to console:

   ```javascript
   const morgan = require('morgan');
   app.use(morgan('combined', { stream: { write: () => {} } }));
   ```

3. **Define Endpoint**: Define an endpoint that returns the desired value.

   ```javascript
   app.get('/api/fruits', (req, res) => {
     const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
     res.json(fruits); // This will send the JSON response without any logs
   });
   ```

4. **Start the Server**: Start your server without any logging.

   ```javascript
   app.listen(3000, () => {
     // Comment out or suppress this log
     // console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

By following these steps, your Express server will return the value (in this case, a JSON array of fruits) without outputting any logs to the console.
