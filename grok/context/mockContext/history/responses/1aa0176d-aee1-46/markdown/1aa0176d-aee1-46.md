# Examples of Mathematical Equations

Here are two examples of mathematical equations:

1. **Linear Equation:**
   \[
   y = 2x + 3
   \]
   This is a linear equation where the slope is 2 and the y-intercept is 3. It represents a straight line on a graph.

2. **Quadratic Equation:**
   \[
   y = x^2 - 4x + 4
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation, which can be written in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c \). This particular equation can be factored as \( (x-2)^2 \), indicating that it has a single root at \( x = 2 \).
