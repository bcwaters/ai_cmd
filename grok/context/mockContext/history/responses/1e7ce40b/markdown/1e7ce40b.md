To confirm if your Docker image is running, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command lists all running containers. Here's how to interpret the output:

- **CONTAINER ID**: The unique ID of the container.
- **IMAGE**: The Docker image used to create the container.
- **COMMAND**: The command that was used to start the container.
- **CREATED**: The time elapsed since the container was created.
- **STATUS**: The status of the container (e.g., "Up 5 minutes").
- **PORTS**: The ports that are exposed and mapped.
- **NAMES**: The name given to the container.

If your container is not listed, it might not be running. You can check all containers (running and stopped) with:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

This will show you if your container exists but is not currently running.
