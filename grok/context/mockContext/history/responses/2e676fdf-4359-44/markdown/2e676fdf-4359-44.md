# Current Context Review

The current context we are discussing involves a method to perform string replacement in JavaScript until the modified string matches a specified regular expression. Here's a summary of the context:

- **Regular Expression and String Replacement**: We are using a regular expression (`targetRegex`) to define the pattern that the final string should match. In the example, this pattern is `azaz09`.

- **JavaScript Function**: A function named `replaceUntilMatch` is used to iteratively replace parts of the input string until it matches the `targetRegex`. The function uses a `while` loop to keep replacing the first character of the string with a specified replacement character until the entire string matches the desired pattern.

- **Example Usage**: An example is provided where the original string is "helloworld", and the replacement character is "h". The function is called with these parameters, and the result is logged to the console.

- **Purpose**: The approach ensures that the string is modified iteratively until it satisfies the condition specified by the regular expression.

This context is correctly set and reflects our discussion on iterative string replacement using regular expressions in JavaScript.
