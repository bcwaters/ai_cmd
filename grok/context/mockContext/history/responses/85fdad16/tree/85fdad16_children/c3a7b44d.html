  <div id="content"><h1>Mars: The Red Planet</h1>
<p>Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its iron-rich dust that gives it a reddish appearance, is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest in the solar system. Here's a detailed look at its characteristics based on the information provided earlier:</p>
<h3>Orbital Characteristics</h3>
<p>Mars orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million kilometers. It takes approximately 687 Earth days to complete one orbit. The planet's orbit is elliptical, and its axial tilt is about 25.2 degrees, which is similar to Earth's tilt and results in seasons on Mars, though they last nearly twice as long as those on Earth due to the longer Martian year.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Martian atmosphere is thin, composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95.3%), with nitrogen (2.7%) and argon (1.6%) making up most of the remainder. Traces of oxygen and water vapor are also present. The thin atmosphere and lack of a strong magnetic field mean that Mars is exposed to higher levels of solar radiation compared to Earth. Dust storms on Mars can be global and last for months, obscuring the surface and affecting the planet's temperature.</p>
<h3>Surface and Geology</h3>
<p>Mars' surface is characterized by vast plains, towering volcanoes, and deep canyons. The largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris, are both found on Mars. The planet's surface also shows evidence of ancient river valleys and lake beds, suggesting that water once flowed on its surface. Today, water on Mars is found primarily as ice at the poles and possibly in the subsurface.</p>
<h3>Moons</h3>
<p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids. Phobos, the larger of the two, orbits very close to Mars and is slowly spiraling inward, expected to either crash into the planet or break apart to form a ring in about 50 million years. Deimos, smaller and more distant, orbits Mars more slowly.</p>
<h3>Exploration</h3>
<p>Mars has been a target of exploration for decades. The first successful flyby was achieved by NASA's Mariner 4 in 1965. Since then, numerous missions have been sent to Mars, including orbiters, landers, and rovers. Notable among these are the Viking program in the 1970s, the Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner rover in 1997, and more recently, the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity), the Curiosity rover, and the Perseverance rover, which landed in 2021. These missions have provided detailed data on Mars' geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.</p>
<h3>Future Missions</h3>
<p>Future missions to Mars include NASA's planned Mars Sample Return mission, which aims to bring Martian samples back to Earth for detailed analysis, and the European Space Agency's ExoMars program, which includes a rover designed to drill into the Martian subsurface to search for signs of life. Additionally, various countries and private companies are planning human missions to Mars, with the goal of establishing a presence on the planet in the coming decades.</p>
<p>Mars continues to captivate scientists and the public alike, offering tantalizing clues about the potential for life beyond Earth and the future of human space exploration.</p>
