Here are some examples of inline LaTeX for various mathematical concepts:

- **Softmax function**: The softmax function can be represented as $\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{x_j}}$, where $x_i$ represents the $i$-th element of the input vector.

- **Summation**: A simple summation can be written as $\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n+1}2$.

- **Trigonometric functions**: The Pythagorean identity can be represented as $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$.

- **Big O notation**: Big O notation for an algorithm's time complexity can be written as $O(n \log n)$.

- **Sigmoid function**: The sigmoid function can be represented as $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$.

- **Batch normalization**: The formula for batch normalization can be written as $\hat{x} = \frac{x - E[x]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x] + \epsilon}}$.

- **Gradient descent**: The update rule for gradient descent can be represented as $\theta = \theta - \alpha 
abla_\theta J(\theta)$.

- **Jacobian matrix**: The Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function can be written as $\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix}$.

These examples showcase various mathematical and algorithmic concepts using inline LaTeX notation, which is widely used in fields like machine learning, theoretical computer science, and mathematics.
