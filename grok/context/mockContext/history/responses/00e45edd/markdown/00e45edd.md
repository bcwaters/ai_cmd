To perform a string replacement until it matches a specific regular expression, you can use a loop that continues to replace parts of the string until the entire string matches the desired pattern. Below is an example in JavaScript that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```javascript
// Define the regular expression you want the string to match
let targetRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]/;

// Function to perform the replacement until the string matches the regex
function replaceUntilMatch(str, replacement) {
    while (!targetRegex.test(str)) {
        // Replace the first character with the specified replacement
        str = replacement + str.slice(1);
    }
    return str;
}

// Example usage
let originalString = '"Hello world"';
let replacementChar = 'H';

let result = replaceUntilMatch(originalString, replacementChar);
console.log(result); // Output: "Helloworld"
```

In this example:

- `targetRegex` is the regular expression you want the final string to match.
- The `replaceUntilMatch` function uses a `while` loop to keep replacing the first character of the string with the `replacementChar` until the string matches `targetRegex`.
- `originalString` is the string you want to modify.
- `replacementChar` is the character you want to use for replacement.

This approach ensures that the string is modified iteratively until it satisfies the condition specified by the regular expression.
