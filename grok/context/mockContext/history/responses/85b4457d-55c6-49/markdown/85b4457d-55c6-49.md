# Cool Facts About Fish

- **Diverse Species**: There are over 33,000 known species of fish, making them the most diverse group of vertebrates on the planet.

- **Ancient Creatures**: Fish have been on Earth for more than 500 million years, predating the dinosaurs by about 100 million years.

- **Fish in Space**: In 1973, mummichog fish became the first fish to travel to space aboard Skylab, NASA's first space station.

- **Lungfish**: Some fish, like the lungfish, can breathe air and survive out of water for extended periods. They have both gills and lungs.

- **Electric Eels**: Electric eels can generate electric shocks of up to 600 volts to stun prey and defend themselves.

- **Glowing Fish**: Some deep-sea fish, like the anglerfish, have bioluminescent organs that produce light to attract prey in the dark depths.

- **Fish Schools**: Fish often swim in schools for protection from predators. The synchronized movement can confuse predators and make it harder for them to target an individual fish.

- **Fast Swimmers**: The sailfish is the fastest fish in the ocean, capable of swimming at speeds up to 68 miles per hour.

- **Temperature Regulation**: Some fish, like the tuna and the great white shark, can maintain a body temperature higher than the surrounding water, a process known as regional endothermy.

- **Coral Reefs**: Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine life, including thousands of fish species, despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor.
