Our solar system consists of eight planets, each unique in its characteristics and composition. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Mercury**: The smallest planet, closest to the Sun. It has no moons and a very thin atmosphere.
2. **Venus**: Often called Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and composition. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet.
3. **Earth**: Our home planet, known for its diverse ecosystems and the only known planet to support life. It has one natural satellite, the Moon.
4. **Mars**: Known as the Red Planet due to its iron-rich dust. Mars has a thin atmosphere and two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.
5. **Jupiter**: The largest planet, a gas giant with a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including the four large Galilean moons.
6. **Saturn**: Famous for its stunning ring system, Saturn is another gas giant with many moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere.
7. **Uranus**: An ice giant with a unique tilt that causes extreme seasons. It has a faint ring system and several moons.
8. **Neptune**: The farthest known planet from the Sun, another ice giant with strong winds and several moons, including Triton.
