To parse multiple shell commands with arguments, you can represent them sequentially in your documentation or markdown. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
command1 arg1 arg2 arg3; command2 argA argB argC
```

In this format:
- `command1` is the first shell command with its arguments `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3`.
- `;` is used to separate the commands, indicating that the second command should run after the first one completes.
- `command2` is the second shell command with its arguments `argA`, `argB`, and `argC`.

For example, if you want to list files with detailed information and in reverse chronological order, and then search for a pattern in multiple files, it would look like this:

```bash
ls -l -r; grep pattern file1.txt file2.txt
```

This format allows you to clearly show multiple commands and their respective arguments, making it easy to understand and replicate in a shell environment.
