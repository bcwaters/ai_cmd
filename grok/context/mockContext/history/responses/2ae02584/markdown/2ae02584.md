- **Docker Hub**: Offers a free plan that allows you to host unlimited public repositories. For private repositories, the free plan includes one private repository.
- **GitHub Container Registry**: If you have a GitHub account, you can use the GitHub Container Registry for free to host both public and private Docker images, with limits based on your GitHub plan.
- **GitLab Container Registry**: Similar to GitHub, GitLab offers a free container registry for both public and private images, with storage limits depending on your GitLab plan.
