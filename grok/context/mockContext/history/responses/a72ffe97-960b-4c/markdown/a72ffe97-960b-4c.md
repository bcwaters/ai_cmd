To view file sizes in the terminal, you can use several commands depending on your operating system. Here are some common methods:

### For Unix/Linux/MacOS:

1. **Using `ls` command:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh
   ```
   This command lists files and directories in a human-readable format, showing sizes in KB, MB, etc.

2. **Using `du` command:**
   ```bash
   du -h --max-depth=1
   ```
   This command estimates disk usage and shows sizes in a human-readable format for the current directory and its subdirectories up to one level deep.

3. **Using `find` command:**
   ```bash
   find . -type f -exec ls -lh {} +
   ```
   This command finds all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and lists them with their sizes.

### For Windows:

1. **Using `dir` command:**
   ```cmd
   dir
   ```
   This command lists files and directories, but sizes are shown in bytes. For a more readable format, you can use:
   ```cmd
   dir /w
   ```

2. **Using PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem | Format-Table Name, Length
   ```
   This command lists files and their sizes in bytes. To get sizes in a more human-readable format, you can use:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem | Format-Table Name, @{Label="Size";Expression={$_.Length / 1KB; "MB"}}
   ```

These commands should help you view file sizes directly from the terminal on various operating systems.
