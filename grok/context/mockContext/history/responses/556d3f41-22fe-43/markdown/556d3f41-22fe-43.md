Here are some more LaTeX equations, presented in both inline and code block formats:

### Inline LaTeX Equations

- The **sine rule** in trigonometry is expressed as \(\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}\).
- The **cosine rule** can be written as \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C\).
- The **slope of a line** is given by \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\).

### LaTeX Equations in Code Blocks

```latex
% Sine Rule
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
```

```latex
% Cosine Rule
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C
```

```latex
% Slope of a Line
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
```

These equations showcase different mathematical concepts using LaTeX syntax, demonstrating both inline and block representations for trigonometry and linear algebra concepts.
