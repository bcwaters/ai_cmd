Here are two syntax facts about regular expressions (regex):

1. **Character Classes**:
   - In regex, character classes are defined using square brackets `[]`. For example, `[abc]` matches any single character `a`, `b`, or `c`. You can also use ranges, such as `[a-z]` to match any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.

2. **Quantifiers**:
   - Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should be matched. For instance, `*` means zero or more occurrences, `+` means one or more occurrences, and `?` means zero or one occurrence. For example, `a*` matches zero or more `a`s, and `a+` matches one or more `a`s.
