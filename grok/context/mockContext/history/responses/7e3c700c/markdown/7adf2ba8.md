# Quantifiers in Regular Expressions

Quantifiers are crucial components of regular expressions (regex) that allow you to specify how many times a character or a group of characters should occur in a match. Here's a detailed look at the quantifiers mentioned previously and some additional ones:

- **Zero or More (`*`)**: The asterisk `*` is used to indicate that the preceding character or group can appear zero or more times. For example, the pattern `a*` matches an empty string or any sequence of the letter 'a'. It's important to note that this quantifier can lead to greedy matching, where the regex engine tries to match as many characters as possible.

- **One or More (`+`)**: The plus sign `+` indicates that the preceding character or group must appear at least once and can appear multiple times. For example, `a+` will match 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', and so on, but not an empty string. Like `*`, `+` is also greedy by default.

- **Zero or One (`?`)**: The question mark `?` specifies that the preceding character or group can appear zero times or once. For example, `colou?r` will match both 'color' and 'colour'. This quantifier is useful for matching optional characters.

### Additional Quantifiers:

- **Exact Number (`{n}`)**: This quantifier specifies that the preceding character or group should occur exactly `n` times. For example, `a{3}` will match exactly three 'a's.

- **Range (`{n,m}`)**: This allows you to specify a range of occurrences. The preceding character or group should appear at least `n` times and at most `m` times. For example, `a{2,4}` will match 'aa', 'aaa', and 'aaaa'.

- **At Least (`{n,}`)**: This specifies that the preceding character or group should occur at least `n` times. For example, `a{2,}` will match 'aa', 'aaa', 'aaaa', and so on.

- **Non-Greedy Quantifiers**: By adding a `?` after any of the above quantifiers, you can make them non-greedy. This means they will match as few characters as possible. For example, `a*?` will match an empty string or the first 'a' it encounters, rather than all 'a's.

Understanding and using quantifiers effectively can greatly enhance your ability to perform complex text matching and manipulation tasks with regex.
