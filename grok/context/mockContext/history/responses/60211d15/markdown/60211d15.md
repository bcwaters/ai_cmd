# Regex for Removing Non-Alphabetic Characters

To remove all non-alphabetic characters from a string, you can use the following regular expression:

```regex
[^a-zA-Z]
```

This pattern matches any character that is not a letter from A to Z or a to z. To use it for replacement, you would typically replace matches of this pattern with an empty string.
