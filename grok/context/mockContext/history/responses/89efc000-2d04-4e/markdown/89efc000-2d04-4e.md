Here are ten more LaTeX equations formatted in markdown with LaTeX syntax:

1. **Pythagorean Theorem**

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]

   where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.

2. **Quadratic Formula**

   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

   where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are coefficients of the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).

3. **Area of a Circle**

   \[
   A = \pi r^2
   \]

   where \(A\) is the area of the circle and \(r\) is the radius.

4. **Volume of a Sphere**

   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]

   where \(V\) is the volume of the sphere and \(r\) is the radius.

5. **Slope Formula**

   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]

   where \(m\) is the slope, \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are two points on a line.

6. **Euler's Identity**

   \[
   e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
   \]

   where \(e\) is the base of the natural logarithm, \(i\) is the imaginary unit, and \(\pi\) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

7. **Binomial Theorem**

   \[
   (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
   \]

   where \(a\) and \(b\) are any numbers, \(n\) is a non-negative integer, and \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient.

8. **Derivative of a Function**

   \[
   f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
   \]

   where \(f'(x)\) is the derivative of \(f(x)\) at point \(x\).

9. **Integral of a Function**

   \[
   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
   \]

   where \(F(x)\) is the antiderivative of \(f(x)\), and \(a\) and \(b\) are the limits of integration.

10. **Limit Definition**

    \[
    \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L
    \]

    where \(L\) is the limit of the function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\).
