To enhance your navbar CSS, consider the following improvements, which align with modern design principles and user experience enhancements:

### 1. **Enhance Hover Effects**

Your current hover effects on navigation links and buttons are simple. Consider adding a more dynamic transition or a subtle background color change to make interactions feel more responsive and visually appealing.

```css
nav a:hover {
  color: #007bff;
  text-decoration: underline;
  background-color: rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.1);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.nav-button:hover {
  background-color: #008CBA;
  color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### 2. **Improve Accessibility**

Ensure that your navbar is accessible by adding appropriate ARIA labels and ensuring sufficient color contrast. For instance, the current text color might not provide enough contrast against the background for all users.

```css
nav a {
  color: #333; /* Consider darker text for better contrast */
}

/* Add ARIA labels to navigation elements */
<nav aria-label="Main Navigation">
  <!-- Your navigation items here -->
</nav>
```

### 3. **Refine Mobile Experience**

Your responsive design for mobile devices is functional but can be enhanced. Consider improving the layout and interaction for smaller screens, such as using a hamburger menu for navigation links.

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  nav {
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  .nav-toggle {
    display: block;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  .nav-menu {
    display: none;
  }

  .nav-menu.show {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top: 10px;
  }
}
```

### 4. **Subtle Shadows and Borders**

Add subtle shadows or borders to elements within the navbar to give them a lifted effect, enhancing the depth and visual hierarchy.

```css
nav {
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0; /* Adds a subtle bottom border */
}

.nav-button {
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);
}
```

### 5. **Consistent Typography**

Ensure that your typography is consistent across all elements within the navbar. Consider using a more distinct font weight or size for better readability and visual hierarchy.

```css
nav a {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400; /* Increased from 300 for better readability */
  font-size: 16px; /* Larger size for better touch targets on mobile */
}
```

### 6. **Integration of Icons**

Adding icons next to text labels can enhance usability, especially on mobile devices. Ensure icons are scalable and have appropriate alt text for accessibility.

```css
nav a {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

nav a img {
  margin-right: 5px;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
}
```

### 7. **Search Box Refinement**

Your search box design is good but could be enhanced with smoother transitions and a more integrated look.

```css
.search-container input[type="text"] {
  transition: border-color 0.3s ease;
}

.search-container input[type="text"]:focus {
  border-color: #007bff;
}
```

These enhancements should make your navbar more visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible, improving the overall user experience on your website.
