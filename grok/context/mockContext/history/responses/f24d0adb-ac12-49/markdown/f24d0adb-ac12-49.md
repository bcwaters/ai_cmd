Here are some LaTeX equations to demonstrate various mathematical concepts:

### Big O Notation
For an algorithm with quadratic time complexity:
```latex
O(n^2)
```

### Turing Machine Transition Function
The transition function of a Turing machine can be represented as:
```latex
\delta(q, a) = (q', a', d)
```
where $q$ and $q'$ are states, $a$ and $a'$ are symbols, and $d$ is the direction of movement.

### Halting Problem
The halting problem, which is undecidable, can be expressed as:
```latex
\text{Halt}(P, I)
```
Given a program $P$ and input $I$, it is impossible to determine in general whether $P$ will halt on $I$.

### Regular Expression
A regular expression for a language that accepts strings of $a$s and $b$s where the number of $a$s is even can be written as:
```latex
(a^*b^*)^*
```

### Linear Equation
A simple linear equation:
```latex
2x + 3 = 7
```

### Quadratic Equation
A quadratic equation:
```latex
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
```

### Derivative
The derivative of a function $f(x) = x^2$:
```latex
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x
```

### Integral
The integral of a function $f(x) = x$:
```latex
\int x \, dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C
```

### System of Equations
A system of linear equations:
```latex
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
2x - y = 1
\end{cases}
```

### Matrix
A 2x2 matrix:
```latex
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
```

### Limit
The limit of a function as $x$ approaches 0:
```latex
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
```

These equations cover a range of mathematical concepts and should help with parsing LaTeX output.
