Here are some examples of LaTeX equations, both inline and in code blocks:

### Inline LaTeX Equations

- The Pythagorean theorem can be written as \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).
- Einstein's mass-energy equivalence is given by \(E = mc^2\).
- The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).
- The area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\).

### LaTeX Equations in Code Blocks

```latex
% Pythagorean theorem
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

% Einstein's mass-energy equivalence
\[ E = mc^2 \]

% Quadratic formula
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

% Area of a circle
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]
```

These examples demonstrate how to include mathematical expressions in both inline and block formats using LaTeX syntax within Markdown.
