# Vercel.json Location and Bypassing Image Optimization

Yes, the `vercel.json` file is typically located in the root directory of your Vercel project. If you can't find it, make sure to check the root folder of your project, as it's essential for configuring various aspects of your Vercel deployment, including image optimization settings.

Regarding bypassing Vercel's image optimization due to occasional failures and the need for control, you can indeed achieve this by modifying the `vercel.json` file or by using direct URLs in your image tags. Here's how you can do it:

### Modifying vercel.json

If you find your `vercel.json`, you can add the following configuration to disable image optimization for specific domains:

```json
{
  "images": {
    "domains": ["yourdirectimageurl.com"],
    "disableStaticImages": true
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel not to optimize images from `yourdirectimageurl.com`.

### Using Direct URLs

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use or modify the `vercel.json`, you can bypass optimization by directly referencing the image URL in your HTML:

```html
<img src="https://yourdirectimageurl.com/image.jpg" alt="description">
```

This method gives you full control over the image delivery without relying on Vercel's optimization.

### Follow-up Questions

- Have you checked the root directory thoroughly for the `vercel.json` file?
- Are there specific images or scenarios where Vercel's optimization fails?
- What level of control do you need over your images that Vercel's optimization doesn't provide?
