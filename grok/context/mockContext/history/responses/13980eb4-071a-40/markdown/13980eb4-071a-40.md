# Testing Audio Levels

It seems like you are testing your audio or input levels with "testing one two three." This is a common practice to ensure that your microphone or input device is functioning correctly and that the levels are set appropriately.

If you need further assistance with audio settings or any other technical aspect, feel free to ask!

### Follow-up Questions:
- Are you having any issues with your audio setup?
- Do you need help adjusting your microphone levels?
- Is there anything specific you want to know about audio testing?
