# Does Butter Spoil?

Yes, butter can spoil. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Shelf Life:** Unopened butter can last in the refrigerator for up to one month past the printed date. Once opened, it typically lasts about 2-3 weeks in the fridge.
- **Signs of Spoilage:** Spoiled butter may have a sour smell, an off taste, or visible mold. If you notice any of these signs, it's best to discard the butter.
- **Storage:** To extend its shelf life, keep butter in an airtight container to minimize exposure to air and potential contaminants.
- **Freezing:** Butter can be frozen to prolong its usability. When stored in the freezer, it can last up to 6-9 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before use.

Understanding these factors will help you manage butter's freshness and safety.
