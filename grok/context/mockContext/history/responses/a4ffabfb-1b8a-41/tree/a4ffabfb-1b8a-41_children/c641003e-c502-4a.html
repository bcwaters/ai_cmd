<h3>Mini-batch Gradient Descent</h3>
<p>Mini-batch gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in training neural networks, which strikes a balance between the efficiency of batch gradient descent and the noise of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Here is a detailed breakdown of its components and implementation:</p>
<h4>Update Rule</h4>
<p>The update rule for mini-batch gradient descent is given by:</p>
<p>[ w_{new} = w_{old} - \eta \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} 
abla J(w_{old}, x_i, y_i) ]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>( w_{new} ) represents the updated weight after processing a mini-batch.</li>
<li>( w_{old} ) is the weight before the update.</li>
<li>( \eta ) is the learning rate, which determines the step size during each update.</li>
<li>( m ) is the size of the mini-batch, typically ranging from 32 to 256, though this can vary based on the dataset and computational resources.</li>
<li>( 
abla J(w_{old}, x_i, y_i) ) denotes the gradient of the loss function ( J ) with respect to the weights, calculated for each example ( (x_i, y_i) ) in the mini-batch.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>: By processing data in mini-batches, mini-batch gradient descent can utilize parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware, such as GPUs, more effectively than SGD.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Variance</strong>: Compared to SGD, mini-batch gradient descent has less noisy updates because the gradient is averaged over multiple examples, leading to more stable convergence.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Usage</strong>: It requires less memory than batch gradient descent since it processes only a subset of the data at a time, making it feasible for larger datasets.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Implementation Details</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch Selection</strong>: Mini-batches are typically selected randomly from the training data to ensure that the model sees a diverse set of examples in each iteration.</li>
<li><strong>Epochs and Iterations</strong>: An epoch is completed when all training examples have been used for updating the model. Within an epoch, multiple iterations occur, each processing a different mini-batch.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Rate Scheduling</strong>: The learning rate ( \eta ) may be adjusted during training using techniques like learning rate decay or adaptive methods such as Adam or RMSprop to improve convergence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choosing Mini-batch Size</strong>: The choice of ( m ) can significantly impact the training dynamics. A smaller ( m ) can lead to faster but noisier updates, while a larger ( m ) can result in slower but more stable updates.</li>
<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: The balance between speed and stability in mini-batch gradient descent requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, including the learning rate and mini-batch size.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Practical Considerations</h4>
<p>In practice, mini-batch gradient descent is widely used due to its effectiveness in training deep neural networks. It is implemented in many deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, where users can easily specify the mini-batch size and other training parameters.</p>
