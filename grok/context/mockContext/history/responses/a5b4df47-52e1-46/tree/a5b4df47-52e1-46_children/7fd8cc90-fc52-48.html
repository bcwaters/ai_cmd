<h3>Linear Equation in Standard Form</h3>
<p>The standard form of a linear equation is expressed as:</p>
<p>[ Ax + By = C ]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are constants.</li>
<li>( A ) and ( B ) are not both zero.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Components of the Equation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>( A ) and ( B )</strong>: These coefficients represent the weights of the variables ( x ) and ( y ). The ratio ( \frac{A}{B} ) gives the slope of the line when rearranged into slope-intercept form.</li>
<li><strong>( C )</strong>: This constant term represents the offset from the origin. When ( x ) and ( y ) are both zero, ( C ) is the value that the equation equals.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Characteristics and Uses</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Any linear equation can be written in standard form, and it is unique up to a non-zero scalar multiple. This means that multiplying the entire equation by a non-zero constant still results in an equivalent equation.</li>
<li><strong>Slope</strong>: To find the slope from the standard form, you can rearrange the equation to solve for ( y ):
[ By = -Ax + C ]
[ y = -\frac{A}{B}x + \frac{C}{B} ]
The slope ( m ) is ( -\frac{A}{B} ).</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts</strong>: The ( x )-intercept can be found by setting ( y = 0 ):
[ Ax = C ]
[ x = \frac{C}{A} ]
The ( y )-intercept can be found by setting ( x = 0 ):
[ By = C ]
[ y = \frac{C}{B} ]</li>
</ul>
<h4>Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphing</strong>: The standard form is useful for graphing because it directly provides the intercepts. Plotting the ( x )- and ( y )-intercepts and drawing a line through them gives the graph of the equation.</li>
<li><strong>Solving Systems</strong>: When solving systems of linear equations, the standard form is often used because it simplifies the process of elimination or substitution.</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Problems</strong>: In real-world applications, such as budgeting or resource allocation, the standard form can represent constraints where ( x ) and ( y ) are variables representing different quantities, and ( C ) represents a total or limit.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: ( 2x + 3y = 6 )</p>
<ul>
<li>( x )-intercept: ( x = \frac{6}{2} = 3 )</li>
<li>( y )-intercept: ( y = \frac{6}{3} = 2 )</li>
<li>Slope: ( m = -\frac{2}{3} )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: ( 4x - 5y = 20 )</p>
<ul>
<li>( x )-intercept: ( x = \frac{20}{4} = 5 )</li>
<li>( y )-intercept: ( y = \frac{20}{-5} = -4 )</li>
<li>Slope: ( m = \frac{4}{5} )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
