Here are several LaTeX equations to demonstrate various mathematical concepts:

### Softmax Function
The softmax function is often used in machine learning for classification tasks. It converts a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution.

$$
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{x_j}}
$$

### Exponential Function
The exponential function is a fundamental mathematical function used in many areas of science and engineering.

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}
$$

### Vector Normalization
Vector normalization is used to scale a vector to have a magnitude of 1.

$$
\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

### Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

### Area of a Circle
The formula for the area of a circle is a fundamental geometric equation.

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

### Volume of a Sphere
The volume of a sphere is given by the following equation.

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

### Slope Formula
The slope of a line between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is calculated as follows.

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

### Euler's Identity
Euler's identity is often considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics.

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

### Binomial Theorem
The binomial theorem describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial.

$$
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
$$

### Derivative
The derivative of a function represents an infinitesimal change in the function with respect to one of its variables.

$$
\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### Integral
The integral of a function represents the area under the curve of the function.

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$

### Limit Definition
The limit of a function as \( x \) approaches a certain value is a fundamental concept in calculus.

$$
\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L
$$
