Here are examples of LaTeX in code blocks for various mathematical and computer science concepts:

### Big O Notation

```latex
\begin{align}
O(n) & \text{ represents linear time complexity} \\
O(n^2) & \text{ represents quadratic time complexity} \\
O(\log n) & \text{ represents logarithmic time complexity} \\
O(n \log n) & \text{ represents linearithmic time complexity}
\end{align}
```

### Turing Machines

```latex
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}
```

### P vs NP Problem

```latex
P \stackrel{?}{=} NP
```

### Complexity Classes

```latex
\begin{align}
P & \models \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k \\
NP & \models \exists \text{ a nondeterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k \\
PSPACE & \models \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ uses space } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k \\
EXPTIME & \models \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(2^{n^k}) \text{ for some } k
\end{align}
```

These examples demonstrate how to use LaTeX code blocks to represent theoretical computer science concepts effectively.
