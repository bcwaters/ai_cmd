# Audio Testing

Here's a quick guide on how to perform an audio test:

1. **Microphone Check**: Ensure your microphone is properly connected and recognized by your system. Speak into the microphone and check if the audio levels are registering.

2. **Audio Levels**: Adjust the input volume to an optimal level. You can do this through your system's sound settings. Aim for a level that captures your voice clearly without distortion.

3. **Equipment Setup**: Make sure all your audio equipment, like headphones or speakers, are set up correctly. Test playback to ensure everything is working as expected.
