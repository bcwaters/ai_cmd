# Architecture Considerations for Query Parameter Processing

When considering the architecture for your application that involves handling query parameters from a webpage, forwarding them to a third-party API, and returning the results, you have two primary options to consider: using NGINX alone with a Node.js command, or using NGINX with Express.js. Let's evaluate both options:

## Option 1: Using NGINX with Node.js Command

In this setup, NGINX would serve static HTML files and could be configured to execute a Node.js command upon receiving a request with query parameters. This approach would look like:

- **NGINX**: Serves static HTML and forwards requests to Node.js for processing.
- **Node.js**: Runs a script to parse query parameters, call the third-party API, and return the result.

**Pros:**
- Reduced overhead from not using Express, which can be beneficial for simple applications.
- NGINX can handle load balancing and caching efficiently.

**Cons:**
- Less flexibility in handling complex routing or middleware.
- Debugging and maintaining a standalone Node.js script might be more challenging compared to an Express application.

## Option 2: Using NGINX with Express.js

Here, NGINX would still serve static files but would forward requests to an Express.js application running on Node.js, which would handle the query parameters and API interactions.

- **NGINX**: Serves static HTML and acts as a reverse proxy to forward requests to Express.
- **Express.js**: Parses query parameters, interacts with the third-party API, and processes the response before sending it back to the client.

**Pros:**
- Express provides a robust framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware, which can be beneficial for more complex applications.
- Easier to manage and scale due to the structured nature of Express applications.

**Cons:**
- Additional overhead from Express, which might not be necessary for simpler use cases.

## Recommendation

If your application is simple and primarily needs to parse query parameters and forward them to an API, using NGINX to execute a Node.js command could be sufficient. This approach minimizes overhead and leverages NGINX's strengths in serving static content and managing requests.

However, if your application might grow in complexity or requires more sophisticated routing and middleware capabilities, using NGINX with Express.js would be more suitable. Express provides a more structured environment for handling HTTP requests and can scale more easily with your application's needs.

In summary, choose the first option for simplicity and efficiency in straightforward scenarios, and the second for flexibility and scalability in more complex or evolving applications.
