# System Prompts in OpenAI API Calls

In the context of using the OpenAI API, system prompts are typically used to set the context or behavior for the entire conversation. They are generally placed at the beginning of the conversation to guide the model's responses throughout the interaction. Here's how system prompts interact with user prompts:

## Placement of System Prompts

- **Typical Use**: System prompts are usually provided before any user prompts to establish the initial context or to set specific rules for the conversation.
- **After User Prompts**: While it's less common, system prompts can technically be inserted after user prompts in a sequence of API calls. However, this might lead to confusion in the model's understanding of the conversation flow.

## Effects of Positioning

- **Before User Prompts**: When a system prompt is placed at the start, it helps in maintaining a consistent tone or behavior throughout the conversation.
- **After User Prompts**: If a system prompt is introduced after user prompts, it might cause the model to shift its behavior mid-conversation, which could be disorienting or lead to inconsistent responses.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: For clarity and consistency, it's recommended to place system prompts at the beginning of the conversation.
- **Mid-Conversation Adjustments**: If adjustments to the conversation's direction or tone are needed, it's better to use a user prompt to subtly guide the model rather than introducing a new system prompt.

## Example

Here's how you might structure an API call with system and user prompts:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that provides concise answers."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can system prompts come after user prompts?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Typically, system prompts are used at the beginning to set the context for the entire conversation. Placing them after user prompts is less common and may affect the conversation's flow."}
  ]
}
```

In this example, the system prompt sets the tone for the entire conversation, and the user prompt follows to ask a specific question.
