<h2>Quadratic Equation: ( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 )</h2>
<h3>Detailed Explanation</h3>
<p>The quadratic equation given, ( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 ), is a second-degree polynomial equation that describes a parabola when graphed. The general form of a quadratic equation is ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are constants. In this case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), and ( c = 4 ).</p>
<h4>Components</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coefficient ( a )</strong>: This determines the direction and width of the parabola. Since ( a = 1 ) (positive), the parabola opens upwards.</li>
<li><strong>Coefficient ( b )</strong>: Affects the position of the parabola along the x-axis.</li>
<li><strong>Coefficient ( c )</strong>: The y-intercept of the parabola, where the graph crosses the y-axis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solving</h3>
<p>The equation ( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 ) can be solved using various methods:</p>
<h4>Factoring</h4>
<p>The quadratic can be factored as:
[
y = (x - 2)^2
]
This indicates that the equation has a double root at ( x = 2 ). The factorization shows that the parabola touches the x-axis at only one point, known as a vertex.</p>
<h4>Quadratic Formula</h4>
<p>The quadratic formula ( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) can be applied:
[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 16}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 0}{2} = 2
]
This confirms the root at ( x = 2 ).</p>
<h4>Completing the Square</h4>
<p>To complete the square:
[
y = x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x^2 - 4x + 4) = (x - 2)^2
]
This method also results in ( (x - 2)^2 ), verifying the vertex form of the equation.</p>
<h3>Graphical Representation</h3>
<p>The graph of ( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 ) is a parabola with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertex</strong>: At ( (2, 0) ). This is the lowest (or highest) point of the parabola.</li>
<li><strong>Axis of Symmetry</strong>: The vertical line ( x = 2 ).</li>
<li><strong>Intercepts</strong>: The parabola touches the x-axis at ( x = 2 ) and the y-axis at ( y = 4 ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1</strong>: If ( x = 0 ), then ( y = 0^2 - 4 \cdot 0 + 4 = 4 ). The point ( (0, 4) ) lies on the parabola.</li>
<li><strong>Example 2</strong>: If ( x = 2 ), then ( y = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 2 + 4 = 0 ). The point ( (2, 0) ) is the vertex and the only x-intercept.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
<p>Quadratic equations are used in various fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physics</strong>: Describing the path of a projectile under gravity.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering</strong>: Designing parabolic shapes for satellite dishes or bridges.</li>
<li><strong>Economics</strong>: Modeling profit functions where revenue and cost are quadratic.</li>
<li><strong>Biology</strong>: Analyzing population growth models.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The quadratic equation ( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 ) is a perfect square trinomial, which simplifies to ( (x - 2)^2 ). It represents a parabola that opens upwards with a vertex at ( (2, 0) ).
