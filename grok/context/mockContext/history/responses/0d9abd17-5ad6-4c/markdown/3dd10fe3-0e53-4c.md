## Quadratic Equation: \( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \)

### Detailed Explanation

The quadratic equation given, \( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \), is a second-degree polynomial equation that describes a parabola when graphed. The general form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants. In this case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = 4 \).

#### Components

- **Coefficient \( a \)**: This determines the direction and width of the parabola. Since \( a = 1 \) (positive), the parabola opens upwards.
- **Coefficient \( b \)**: Affects the position of the parabola along the x-axis.
- **Coefficient \( c \)**: The y-intercept of the parabola, where the graph crosses the y-axis.

### Solving

The equation \( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \) can be solved using various methods:

#### Factoring

The quadratic can be factored as:
\[
y = (x - 2)^2
\]
This indicates that the equation has a double root at \( x = 2 \). The factorization shows that the parabola touches the x-axis at only one point, known as a vertex.

#### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) can be applied:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 16}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 0}{2} = 2
\]
This confirms the root at \( x = 2 \).

#### Completing the Square

To complete the square:
\[
y = x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x^2 - 4x + 4) = (x - 2)^2
\]
This method also results in \( (x - 2)^2 \), verifying the vertex form of the equation.

### Graphical Representation

The graph of \( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a parabola with:
- **Vertex**: At \( (2, 0) \). This is the lowest (or highest) point of the parabola.
- **Axis of Symmetry**: The vertical line \( x = 2 \).
- **Intercepts**: The parabola touches the x-axis at \( x = 2 \) and the y-axis at \( y = 4 \).

### Examples

- **Example 1**: If \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 0^2 - 4 \cdot 0 + 4 = 4 \). The point \( (0, 4) \) lies on the parabola.
- **Example 2**: If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 2 + 4 = 0 \). The point \( (2, 0) \) is the vertex and the only x-intercept.

### Real-World Applications

Quadratic equations are used in various fields:

- **Physics**: Describing the path of a projectile under gravity.
- **Engineering**: Designing parabolic shapes for satellite dishes or bridges.
- **Economics**: Modeling profit functions where revenue and cost are quadratic.
- **Biology**: Analyzing population growth models.

### Summary

The quadratic equation \( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial, which simplifies to \( (x - 2)^2 \). It represents a parabola that opens upwards with a vertex at \( (2, 0) \). The equation is significant in multiple disciplines for modeling and solving problems involving quadratic relationships.
