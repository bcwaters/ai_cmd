Here are two equations for you:

1. **Linear Equation:**
   \[
   y = 2x + 3
   \]
   - This equation represents a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3.

2. **Quadratic Equation:**
   \[
   y = x^2 - 4x + 4
   \]
   - This equation represents a parabola. It can be factored as \( (x-2)^2 \), indicating that it has a vertex at (2, 0) and touches the x-axis at one point.
