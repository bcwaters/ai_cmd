To add rehype-mathjax to your unified pipeline, you can follow these steps. This will enable you to render mathematical equations within your Markdown documents using MathJax. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Install the necessary packages:**

   You'll need to install `unified`, `remark-parse`, `remark-rehype`, `rehype-mathjax`, and `rehype-stringify`. You can do this using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install unified remark-parse remark-rehype rehype-mathjax rehype-stringify
   ```

2. **Create a unified pipeline:**

   Below is a sample JavaScript code to create a pipeline that processes Markdown with MathJax:

   ```javascript
   const unified = require('unified')
   const remarkParse = require('remark-parse')
   const remarkRehype = require('remark-rehype')
   const rehypeMathjax = require('rehype-mathjax')
   const rehypeStringify = require('rehype-stringify')

   unified()
     .use(remarkParse)
     .use(remarkRehype)
     .use(rehypeMathjax)
     .use(rehypeStringify)
     .process('*This* is a test with $E=mc^2$.', (error, file) => {
       if (error) throw error
       console.log(String(file))
     })
   ```

3. **Explanation:**

   - `remark-parse` parses Markdown into a syntax tree.
   - `remark-rehype` converts the Markdown syntax tree to an HTML syntax tree.
   - `rehype-mathjax` processes the math within the HTML syntax tree, converting it into MathJax format.
   - `rehype-stringify` converts the HTML syntax tree back into a string, which includes the processed math.

4. **Using the Pipeline:**

   When you run the above code, it processes a simple Markdown string containing an inline math expression. The output will be an HTML string where the math expression is wrapped in a MathJax script for rendering.

5. **Integration with a Build System:**

   If you're using this in a larger project, you might want to integrate this into your build system. For example, with a static site generator like Next.js or Gatsby, you can use this pipeline in your Markdown processing plugins.

By following these steps, you'll be able to render mathematical equations within your Markdown documents using MathJax in your unified pipeline.
