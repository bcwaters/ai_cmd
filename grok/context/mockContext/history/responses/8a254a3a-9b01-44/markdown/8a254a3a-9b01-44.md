# Using NGINX to Run JavaScript

To run JavaScript using NGINX, you can configure NGINX to act as a reverse proxy to a Node.js server where your JavaScript (`scriptToRun.js`) will be executed. Here's a basic setup to achieve this:

### NGINX Configuration

Add the following configuration to your NGINX server block:

```nginx
http {
    ...
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location /run_script {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Assuming Node.js server is running on port 3000
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
}
```

### Node.js Server Setup

You need to set up a Node.js server to handle requests forwarded by NGINX. Here's a simple example using Express.js:

1. **Install Node.js and Express.js** if not already installed.
2. **Create `server.js`**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/run_script', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to run scriptToRun.js goes here
    // For demonstration, we'll just send a response
    res.send('Script executed!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

3. **Run the Node.js server**:

```bash
node server.js
```

### Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that the Node.js server is secured and runs with least privilege to minimize potential vulnerabilities.
- **Input Validation**: Validate any input passed to `scriptToRun.js` to prevent injection attacks.
- **Logging**: Implement logging in both NGINX and Node.js to monitor and debug interactions.

This setup allows NGINX to handle incoming requests and pass them to your Node.js server, which in turn executes your JavaScript script.
