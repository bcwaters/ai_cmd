Here are some LaTeX equations that you can use to test your parser. These examples cover various types of mathematical expressions, which should help you ensure your parser handles different LaTeX syntax correctly.

### Inline Equations

Inline equations are typically used within text and are enclosed by single dollar signs `$...$`.

- **Simple Equation**: $x + 5 = 10$
- **Fraction**: The formula for the area of a circle is given by $A = \pi r^2$.
- **Exponent**: The exponential growth can be expressed as $P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}$.

### Block Equations

Block equations are used for more complex expressions and are enclosed by double dollar signs `$$...$$` or `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}`.

- **Quadratic Equation**:
  $$
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0
  $$
- **Integral**:
  $$
  \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
  $$
- **Matrix**:
  $$
  \begin{pmatrix}
  a & b \\
  c & d
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

### More Advanced Equations

These examples test more complex LaTeX syntax.

- **System of Equations**:
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  3x + 2y = 6 \\
  x - y = 2
  \end{cases}
  $$
- **Derivative**:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx} \left( x^3 \right) = 3x^2
  $$
- **Limit**:
  $$
  \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
  $$

These examples should give you a good starting point to test your LaTeX parser with a variety of mathematical expressions. Make sure to check both the rendering and the correctness of the parsed output.
