# Troubleshooting Docker Build Command

It looks like you encountered a couple of issues with your Docker build command. Let's address them one by one:

### Issue 1: Deprecation Warning
You received a deprecation warning about the legacy builder. Docker is moving towards using BuildKit, which is a more modern and efficient way to build Docker images. To resolve this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install BuildKit**: Follow the instructions at [Docker's Buildx documentation](https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/) to install the buildx component.

2. **Enable BuildKit**: Once installed, enable BuildKit by setting the following environment variable before running your Docker command:
   ```bash
   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
   ```

3. **Use Buildx**: Instead of `docker build`, use the `docker buildx build` command. Here's how you might modify your command:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build -t ai_cmd:test -f ./DockerFile .
   ```

### Issue 2: Incorrect Path Specification
The error message indicates that Docker is trying to use `DockerFile` as a context directory, which is incorrect. The context should be a directory, not a file. Here's how to fix it:

- **Correct Path**: Ensure you're specifying the correct path to the directory containing your Dockerfile. If your Dockerfile is in the current directory, you should use a period (`.`) as the context path.

Here's the corrected command:

```bash
docker build -t ai_cmd:test -f ./DockerFile .
```

Or, with BuildKit:

```bash
docker buildx build -t ai_cmd:test -f ./DockerFile .
```

### Additional Notes:
- The `-f` flag specifies the Dockerfile name if it's not the default `Dockerfile`. If your file is named `DockerFile` (note the capital 'F'), you need to specify it with `-f`.
- Ensure your Dockerfile is named correctly. Docker by default looks for a file named `Dockerfile` (with a lowercase 'f').

Try these adjustments, and let me know if you encounter any further issues.
