Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to sort a list of numbers in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method:

```python
# List of numbers to be sorted
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]

# Sorting the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()

# Printing the sorted list
print(numbers)
```

**Summary:** This code snippet initializes a list of integers, sorts it in ascending order using the `sort()` method, and then prints the sorted list.

Follow-up questions:
- Would you like to see an example of sorting in descending order?
- Are you interested in learning about other sorting algorithms?
- Do you need help with a specific programming task involving lists?
