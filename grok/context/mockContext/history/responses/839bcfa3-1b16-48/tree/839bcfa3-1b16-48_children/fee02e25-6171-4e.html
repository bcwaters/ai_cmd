<h1>Calculus</h1>
<p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and how things change over time. It is divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.</p>
<h2>Derivatives</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. It is the slope of the tangent line to the function at a given point.</li>
<li><strong>Notation</strong>: Commonly denoted as ( f'(x) ) or ( \frac{dy}{dx} ).</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: Used in physics for calculating velocity and acceleration, in economics for marginal analysis, and in engineering for optimization problems.</li>
<li><strong>Rules</strong>: Key rules include the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integrals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: An integral is the reverse of a derivative. It calculates the area under the curve of a function.</li>
<li><strong>Types</strong>: There are two types of integrals: definite and indefinite. Definite integrals have specific limits of integration, while indefinite integrals do not.</li>
<li><strong>Notation</strong>: Indefinite integrals are denoted as ( \int f(x) , dx ), while definite integrals are written as ( \int_a^b f(x) , dx ).</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: Used in physics to find displacement from velocity, in economics for total cost from marginal cost, and in engineering for calculating work.</li>
<li><strong>Techniques</strong>: Key techniques include substitution, integration by parts, and partial fractions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input (or variable) approaches some value.</li>
<li><strong>Notation</strong>: Denoted as ( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) ).</li>
<li><strong>Importance</strong>: Limits are fundamental to calculus as they define derivatives and integrals.</li>
<li><strong>Types</strong>: One-sided limits (from the left or right), infinite limits, and limits at infinity.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: Used to understand the behavior of functions, to find derivatives, and to evaluate improper integrals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculus is essential in many fields because it provides tools to model and analyze dynamic systems. Whether you're calculating the trajectory of a rocket or optimizing a business process, calculus offers the mathematical foundation needed to solve complex problems.</p>
