# Basic Algebra

## Equations
Equations are fundamental to algebra. They are mathematical statements that show the equality between two expressions. In algebra, equations often involve variables, which are symbols that represent unknown values. Common types of equations include:

- **Linear Equations**: These are equations of the first degree, where the highest power of the variable is 1. For example, \(2x + 3 = 7\).
- **Quadratic Equations**: These are second-degree equations, where the highest power of the variable is 2. An example is \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\).
- **Systems of Equations**: These involve multiple equations that need to be solved simultaneously. For example, solving \(x + y = 10\) and \(2x - y = 3\) together.

## Variables
Variables are placeholders for unknown or changing values in algebraic expressions and equations. They allow us to generalize mathematical relationships and solve for specific values. Key points about variables include:

- **Representation**: Variables are usually represented by letters, such as \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\).
- **Types**: Variables can represent different types of quantities, such as real numbers, integers, or even more complex numbers.
- **Manipulation**: Variables can be manipulated using algebraic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve equations.

## Solving
Solving equations in algebra involves finding the values of the variables that make the equation true. Techniques for solving vary based on the type of equation but generally include:

- **Isolating the Variable**: This involves performing operations on both sides of the equation to isolate the variable on one side. For example, to solve \(2x + 3 = 7\), you would subtract 3 from both sides to get \(2x = 4\), then divide both sides by 2 to find \(x = 2\).
- **Using Formulas**: Certain types of equations, like quadratic equations, can be solved using specific formulas. The quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), is used to solve equations of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
- **Graphical Methods**: Sometimes, solving equations can be done graphically by plotting the functions and finding the points of intersection.
