# Calculus

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and how things change over time. It is divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.

## Derivatives
- **Definition**: A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. It is the slope of the tangent line to the function at a given point.
- **Notation**: Commonly denoted as \( f'(x) \) or \( \frac{dy}{dx} \).
- **Applications**: Used in physics for calculating velocity and acceleration, in economics for marginal analysis, and in engineering for optimization problems.
- **Rules**: Key rules include the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.

## Integrals
- **Definition**: An integral is the reverse of a derivative. It calculates the area under the curve of a function.
- **Types**: There are two types of integrals: definite and indefinite. Definite integrals have specific limits of integration, while indefinite integrals do not.
- **Notation**: Indefinite integrals are denoted as \( \int f(x) \, dx \), while definite integrals are written as \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \).
- **Applications**: Used in physics to find displacement from velocity, in economics for total cost from marginal cost, and in engineering for calculating work.
- **Techniques**: Key techniques include substitution, integration by parts, and partial fractions.

## Limits
- **Definition**: A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input (or variable) approaches some value.
- **Notation**: Denoted as \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \).
- **Importance**: Limits are fundamental to calculus as they define derivatives and integrals.
- **Types**: One-sided limits (from the left or right), infinite limits, and limits at infinity.
- **Applications**: Used to understand the behavior of functions, to find derivatives, and to evaluate improper integrals.

Calculus is essential in many fields because it provides tools to model and analyze dynamic systems. Whether you're calculating the trajectory of a rocket or optimizing a business process, calculus offers the mathematical foundation needed to solve complex problems.
