### How to Use:
To use any of these CSS libraries, you typically need to:
1. Include the CSS file in your HTML document.
2. Ensure your Markdown content is wrapped in a container that the CSS is designed to style (e.g., `<div class="markdown-body">` for GitHub Markdown CSS).

Here's a basic example using GitHub Markdown CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styled Markdown</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="github-markdown.css">
</head>
<body>
    <article class="markdown-body">
        <!-- Your Markdown content here -->
    </article>
</body>
</html>
```

These libraries can significantly improve the visual appeal of your Markdown documents rendered with `marked`. Choose the one that best fits your project's aesthetic and functional needs.
