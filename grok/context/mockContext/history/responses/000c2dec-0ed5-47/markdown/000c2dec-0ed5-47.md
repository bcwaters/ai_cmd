# Testing Audio Levels

To ensure your audio equipment is functioning correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Check Connections**: Make sure all cables are securely connected to the appropriate ports.
2. **Adjust Volume**: Set the volume to a moderate level to avoid feedback or distortion.
3. **Test Sound**: Say "testing one two three" into the microphone to check for clarity and volume.

If the audio levels are satisfactory, you're ready to proceed with your recording or presentation.
