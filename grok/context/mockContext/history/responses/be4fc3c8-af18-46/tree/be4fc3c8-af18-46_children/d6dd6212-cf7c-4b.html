<h2>Algebra</h2>
<p>Algebra is a broad branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It is fundamental in solving mathematical problems and is used extensively in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. Here, we delve deeper into the aspects of algebra previously mentioned:</p>
<h3>Focuses on Symbols and the Rules for Manipulating Those Symbols</h3>
<p>Algebra uses letters, often called variables, to represent numbers whose values are not specified or can change. These symbols are manipulated according to specific rules to solve equations and express mathematical relationships. For example, in the equation (2x + 3 = 7), (x) is a variable, and the goal is to find the value of (x) that satisfies the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Key Aspects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables and Constants:</strong> Variables represent unknown values, while constants are fixed numerical values. In the equation (3a + 5 = 14), (a) is a variable, and 3, 5, and 14 are constants.</li>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Algebraic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations follow the standard rules of arithmetic but are applied to both numbers and variables.</li>
<li><strong>Expressions and Equations:</strong> An expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations without an equal sign, such as (3x + 2). An equation includes an equal sign and sets two expressions equal to each other, such as (3x + 2 = 8).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Involves Solving Equations and Studying Algebraic Structures</h3>
<p>Solving equations is a central task in algebra. It involves finding the values of variables that make the equation true. Techniques for solving equations include isolating the variable, using substitution, and applying algebraic rules.</p>
<p><strong>Solving Equations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Equations:</strong> Equations of the form (ax + b = c), where (a), (b), and (c) are constants. Solving (2x + 3 = 7) involves isolating (x): 
[
2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3 \implies 2x = 4 \implies x = \frac{4}{2} \implies x = 2
]</li>
<li><strong>Quadratic Equations:</strong> Equations of the form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). These can be solved using the quadratic formula (x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Studying Algebraic Structures:</strong>
Algebraic structures are sets of mathematical objects with operations defined on them, following certain axioms. These structures include groups, rings, and fields.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Groups:</strong> A set with a single operation that satisfies closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements. For example, the set of integers under addition forms a group.</li>
<li><strong>Rings:</strong> A set with two operations (usually addition and multiplication) where the set is a group under addition, and multiplication is associative and distributes over addition. The integers form a ring under addition and multiplication.</li>
<li><strong>Fields:</strong> A set that is a ring, where the nonzero elements form a group under multiplication. The rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers are examples of fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Algebra is not only about solving equations but also about understanding the underlying structures that govern mathematical operations. It provides the tools and language to describe and solve problems in a wide range of disciplines.</p>
