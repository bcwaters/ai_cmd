<h1>Quadratic Equation</h1>
<p>A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation of the form:</p>
<p>[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
]</p>
<p>where (a), (b), and (c) are constants, and (a 
eq 0). This equation represents a parabola, which is a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve on a graph.</p>
<h2>Detailed Explanation of Components</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>(a)</strong>: This coefficient determines the direction and width of the parabola. If (a &gt; 0), the parabola opens upwards, and if (a &lt; 0), it opens downwards. The absolute value of (a) affects the steepness of the parabola; a larger absolute value makes the parabola narrower, while a smaller absolute value makes it wider.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>(b)</strong>: This coefficient affects the position of the parabola along the x-axis. It shifts the parabola horizontally and influences the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. The term (bx) also affects the symmetry of the parabola about the axis of symmetry.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>(c)</strong>: This constant term represents the y-intercept of the parabola, which is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis. It shifts the parabola vertically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations</h2>
<p>There are several methods to solve quadratic equations:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Factoring</strong></h3>
<p>If the quadratic equation can be factored into the form ((px + q)(rx + s) = 0), then the solutions are found by setting each factor equal to zero:</p>
<p>[
px + q = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad rx + s = 0
]</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Quadratic Formula</strong></h3>
<p>The quadratic formula provides a direct method to find the roots of the equation:</p>
<p>[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
]</p>
<p>Here, the term under the square root, (b^2 - 4ac), is called the discriminant. It determines the nature of the roots:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.</li>
<li>If the discriminant is zero, there is one real root (a repeated root).</li>
<li>If the discriminant is negative, there are two complex conjugate roots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Completing the Square</strong></h3>
<p>This method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial:</p>
<p>[
ax^2 + bx + c = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a}
]</p>
<p>Solving for (x) after setting the equation to zero gives the roots.</p>
<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
<p>Quadratic equations are used in various fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physics</strong>: To describe the motion of objects under the influence of gravity, such as projectile motion.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering</strong>: For designing parabolic reflectors in satellite dishes and telescopes.</li>
<li><strong>Economics</strong>: To model profit and cost functions, where the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function can represent the optimal production level.</li>
<li><strong>Biology</strong>: To model population growth or decay over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Solving a Quadratic Equation</h3>
<p>Consider the equation (2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0). Using the quadratic formula:</p>
<p>[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = \frac{5 \pm 3}{4}
]</p>
<p>This gives us two solutions:</p>
<p>[
x = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
]</p>
<h3>Example 2: Projectile Motion</h3>
<p>If a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 30 m/s from a height of 2 meters, its height (h) as a function of time (t) can be modeled by:</p>
<p>[
h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 30t + 2
]</p>
<p>This is a quadratic equation where the maximum height can be found by determining the vertex of the parabola.</p>
