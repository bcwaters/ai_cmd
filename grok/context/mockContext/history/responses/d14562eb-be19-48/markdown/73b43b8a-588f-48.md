# Quadratic Equation

A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation of the form:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(a 
eq 0\). This equation represents a parabola, which is a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve on a graph.

## Detailed Explanation of Components

- **\(a\)**: This coefficient determines the direction and width of the parabola. If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards, and if \(a < 0\), it opens downwards. The absolute value of \(a\) affects the steepness of the parabola; a larger absolute value makes the parabola narrower, while a smaller absolute value makes it wider.

- **\(b\)**: This coefficient affects the position of the parabola along the x-axis. It shifts the parabola horizontally and influences the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. The term \(bx\) also affects the symmetry of the parabola about the axis of symmetry.

- **\(c\)**: This constant term represents the y-intercept of the parabola, which is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis. It shifts the parabola vertically.

## Solving Quadratic Equations

There are several methods to solve quadratic equations:

### 1. **Factoring**

If the quadratic equation can be factored into the form \((px + q)(rx + s) = 0\), then the solutions are found by setting each factor equal to zero:

\[
px + q = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad rx + s = 0
\]

### 2. **Quadratic Formula**

The quadratic formula provides a direct method to find the roots of the equation:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, the term under the square root, \(b^2 - 4ac\), is called the discriminant. It determines the nature of the roots:

- If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.
- If the discriminant is zero, there is one real root (a repeated root).
- If the discriminant is negative, there are two complex conjugate roots.

### 3. **Completing the Square**

This method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a}
\]

Solving for \(x\) after setting the equation to zero gives the roots.

## Real-World Applications

Quadratic equations are used in various fields:

- **Physics**: To describe the motion of objects under the influence of gravity, such as projectile motion.
- **Engineering**: For designing parabolic reflectors in satellite dishes and telescopes.
- **Economics**: To model profit and cost functions, where the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function can represent the optimal production level.
- **Biology**: To model population growth or decay over time.

## Examples

### Example 1: Solving a Quadratic Equation

Consider the equation \(2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = \frac{5 \pm 3}{4}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Example 2: Projectile Motion

If a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 30 m/s from a height of 2 meters, its height \(h\) as a function of time \(t\) can be modeled by:

\[
h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 30t + 2
\]

This is a quadratic equation where the maximum height can be found by determining the vertex of the parabola.
