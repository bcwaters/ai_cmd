Here are two simple equations for you:

1. **Linear Equation:**
   \[
   y = mx + b
   \]
   This equation represents a straight line where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

2. **Quadratic Equation:**
   \[
   ax^2 + bx + c = 0
   \]
   This equation represents a parabola where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are coefficients that determine the shape and position of the parabola.

Would you like to know more about these equations or perhaps see some examples of how they are used? Here are a few follow-up questions you might consider:

- Can you explain what the slope and y-intercept mean in the context of the linear equation?
- How do you solve a quadratic equation?
- Are there real-world applications for these equations?
