The KaTeX library you're using with the provided configuration does not require elements with a specific class name. Instead, it inspects the innerHTML of the specified element, which in this case is `document.body`. This means it will render mathematical expressions found within the specified delimiters anywhere within the body of the document.

Here's a breakdown of how it works based on your configuration:

- **Target Element**: `document.body` indicates that the entire body of the HTML document will be scanned for mathematical expressions.
- **Delimiters**: The library will look for expressions enclosed in the specified delimiters (`$$`, `$`, `\\[`, `\\]`, `\\(`, `\\)`) within the innerHTML of the body.
- **Display Options**: The `display` property set to `true` or `false` determines whether the rendered math will be displayed in block or inline mode, respectively.

This setup allows for easy integration of mathematical expressions into your web page without needing to manually apply class names or IDs to specific elements. The library automatically processes and renders any math expressions it finds according to the specified rules.
