# Understanding the Error and Correct Status Code for Sending Files

When encountering the `RangeError [ERR_HTTP_INVALID_STATUS_CODE]: Invalid status code: Error sending file` error in Node.js, it's crucial to understand that the error is caused by attempting to set an invalid HTTP status code. The error message suggests that an attempt was made to send a file with a status code that is not a valid HTTP status code.

## Correct Status Code for Sending Files

For sending files successfully, you should use an appropriate HTTP status code. Here are the most common status codes used when sending files:

- **200 OK**: Used when the file is successfully sent and the request is processed correctly.
- **206 Partial Content**: Used when sending a part of the file, typically in response to a range request.

### Example of Correct Usage

When sending a file using Express.js, you should ensure that you're setting a valid status code. Here's an example of how to correctly send a file with Express.js:

```javascript
app.get('/file', (req, res) => {
  const file = `${__dirname}/path/to/your/file.txt`;
  res.status(200).sendFile(file);
});
```

In this example, the status code `200` is explicitly set before calling `sendFile`, ensuring that a valid HTTP status code is used.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check the Status Code**: Ensure that you are not passing an invalid status code to `res.status()` or directly to `res.sendFile()`.
2. **Review Error Handling**: If you're catching errors and trying to send them as a response, make sure you're not accidentally sending the error object as a status code.
3. **Validate Input**: If the status code is dynamically set based on some conditions, validate that it's always a valid HTTP status code.

By following these guidelines and using the appropriate status codes, you should be able to resolve the `RangeError [ERR_HTTP_INVALID_STATUS_CODE]` when sending files in your Node.js application.
