### terminalMode --treeMode

1. **Visualizing Hierarchical Data:**
   terminalMode, also known as treeMode, enhances CLI by displaying data in a tree-like structure. This is particularly useful for understanding nested data such as file systems or organizational charts.

2. **Integration with Visualization Tools:**
   terminalMode can be combined with tools like GNUPlot or Plotext to not only show structure but also overlay statistical data. For example, a script can convert tree output to JSON, process it, and then use GNUPlot to create a visual plot.
