## JavaScript Data Structures

### 1. **Arrays**
Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are indexed collections of data, where each item can be accessed by its index, starting from 0. Arrays are versatile and can hold any type of data, including other arrays, objects, and primitive values. They have built-in methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, and `splice()` for manipulating their elements.

### 2. **Objects**
Objects are key-value pair collections in JavaScript, similar to dictionaries or maps in other languages. They are used to store data in a structured way, allowing you to access values using their corresponding keys. Objects can contain functions (methods), making them useful for creating complex data structures. They are mutable and can be easily extended or modified.

### 3. **Maps**
Maps are part of the ES6 standard and provide a way to store key-value pairs where any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value. Unlike objects, Maps maintain insertion order of the keys and are iterable. They also offer useful methods like `set()`, `get()`, `has()`, `delete()`, and `clear()`.
