Yes, there is a remark library for KaTeX called `remark-math`. It is used to process and render mathematical expressions written in LaTeX syntax within Markdown documents. This library can be integrated with other remark plugins to enhance the processing and rendering of mathematical content in various formats like HTML, using tools like KaTeX for rendering.

Here's a brief example of how you might use `remark-math` in a JavaScript environment:

```javascript
const unified = require('unified')
const markdown = require('remark-parse')
const remarkMath = require('remark-math')
const katex = require('rehype-katex')
const remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
const html = require('rehype-stringify')

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(remarkMath)
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(katex)
  .use(html)
  .process('The quadratic formula is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$', function (err, file) {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a pipeline to parse Markdown with embedded LaTeX, convert it to HTML, and render the math using KaTeX.
