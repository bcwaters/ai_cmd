# Non-Euclidean Geometry

Non-Euclidean geometry refers to several types of geometry that differ from Euclidean geometry, which is based on Euclid's axioms. There are primarily two types of non-Euclidean geometry:

1. **Hyperbolic Geometry**: In this type, the parallel postulate is replaced with the statement that through any point not on a given line, there are at least two distinct lines that do not intersect the given line. This results in a space that can be visualized as a saddle shape.

2. **Elliptic Geometry**: Here, the parallel postulate is replaced by the statement that through any point not on a given line, there are no lines that do not intersect the given line. This leads to a space that can be visualized on the surface of a sphere.

Non-Euclidean geometries have significant implications in various fields, including physics (especially in the theory of general relativity) and computer graphics.

### Follow-up Questions:
- What are some practical applications of non-Euclidean geometry?
- How does non-Euclidean geometry differ from Euclidean geometry in terms of axioms?
- Can you explain the role of non-Euclidean geometry in Einstein's theory of general relativity?
