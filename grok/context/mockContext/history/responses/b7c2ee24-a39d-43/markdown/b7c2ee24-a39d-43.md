To make your search bar wider, you can adjust the width property of the `search-container input[type="text"]` selector in your CSS. Here's how you can modify your existing CSS to achieve this:

```css
.search-container input[type="text"] {
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 4px 0 0 4px;
  font-size: 14px;
  transition: border-color 0.3s ease;
  width: 300px; /* Adjust this value to make the search bar wider */
}

/* For responsive design, you might want to keep the width at 100% for smaller screens */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .search-container input[type="text"] {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

In this modification:

1. We've added a `width` property to the `.search-container input[type="text"]` selector. You can adjust the `300px` value to make the search bar as wide as you want.

2. We've kept the responsive design intact by maintaining `width: 100%` for screens with a maximum width of 600px. This ensures that on smaller devices, the search bar will still take up the full width of its container.

You can replace the existing `.search-container input[type="text"]` rule in your CSS with this new version. If you want the search bar to be even wider, simply increase the `300px` value.

Remember to test this change on different screen sizes to ensure it works well across various devices.
