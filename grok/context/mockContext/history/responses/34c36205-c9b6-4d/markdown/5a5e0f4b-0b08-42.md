### Jupiter

**Size and Position:**
Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers). It is the fifth planet from the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of about 778 million kilometers (484 million miles). Its massive size means it has a significant influence on the solar system's dynamics.

**Atmosphere:**
Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (about 10%), with trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other compounds. The atmosphere is divided into several layers, with the visible cloud tops showing dynamic bands of clouds that run parallel to the equator. These bands are created by differences in temperature and pressure, leading to different wind patterns and colors.

**Great Red Spot:**
The Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in Jupiter's atmosphere, producing an anticyclonic storm that is larger than Earth. This storm has been observed since at least the 17th century and is known for its deep red color, though its size and color have varied over time. The storm's longevity and size make it a significant feature of Jupiter's weather patterns.

**Magnetic Field:**
Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field is generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen within Jupiter's core. The magnetosphere extends millions of kilometers into space and traps charged particles, creating intense radiation belts around the planet.

**Moons:**
Jupiter has 79 known moons, with the four largest known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Each of these moons has unique characteristics:
- **Io** is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
- **Europa** has a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, which is of great interest for potential life.
- **Ganymede** is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one known to have its own magnetic field.
- **Callisto** has an ancient, heavily cratered surface and is thought to have a subsurface ocean.

**Exploration:**
Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including:
- **Pioneer 10** and **Pioneer 11** in the 1970s, which provided the first close-up images of the planet.
- **Voyager 1** and **Voyager 2** in 1979, which offered detailed images and data about Jupiter and its moons.
- **Galileo** orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, providing extensive data on the planet's atmosphere, magnetosphere, and moons.
- **Juno**, launched in 2011, is currently orbiting Jupiter to study its composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere.
