Here are two planets in our solar system:

### Mars
Mars is known as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is the fourth planet from the Sun and has a thin atmosphere. Mars has been explored by several robotic missions, and there's ongoing interest in its potential for past or present life.

### Jupiter
Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, known for its Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth, and its prominent bands of clouds. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and has a thick atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including the four large Galilean moons.
