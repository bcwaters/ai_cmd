<h2>Components of an AST</h2>
<p>An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is composed of various elements that together represent the syntactic structure of the source code or text. Let's delve deeper into the components mentioned: Nodes and Edges.</p>
<h3>Nodes</h3>
<p>Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of an AST. They represent different constructs within the source code or text, and each type of node serves a specific purpose. Here's a more detailed look at the different types of nodes:</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p><strong>Function Nodes</strong> represent function definitions in the code. They are crucial because they encapsulate the entire function, including its name, parameters, and body. For example, in Python, a function node for <code>def greet(name):</code> would include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name Node</strong>: This node contains the name of the function, in this case, <code>greet</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Arguments Node</strong>: This node represents the function's parameters. It could contain child nodes like <code>arg</code> nodes for each parameter, such as an <code>arg</code> node for <code>name</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Body Node</strong>: This node represents the body of the function, which might contain multiple child nodes representing statements or expressions within the function.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Expressions</h4>
<p><strong>Expression Nodes</strong> represent operations or values within the code. They are used to denote various types of expressions, such as arithmetic operations, function calls, or variable references. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary Operation Node</strong>: Represents operations like addition or subtraction, with child nodes for the left and right operands.</li>
<li><strong>Call Node</strong>: Represents function calls, such as the <code>print</code> function in <code>print(f"Hello, {name}!")</code>. It would have a child node for the function name and another for the arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Literal Node</strong>: Represents constant values like numbers or strings, such as <code>42</code> or <code>"Hello, World!"</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Node</strong>: Represents references to variables, such as <code>name</code> in <code>greet(name)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Statements</h4>
<p><strong>Statement Nodes</strong> represent the control flow and structure of the code. They are essential for understanding the sequence of operations in a program. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If Node</strong>: Represents conditional statements, with child nodes for the condition, the body, and possibly an else clause.</li>
<li><strong>Loop Node</strong>: Represents loops like <code>for</code> or <code>while</code>, with child nodes for the loop condition, the loop body, and possibly initialization and update expressions.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment Node</strong>: Represents variable assignments, with child nodes for the left-hand side (the variable) and the right-hand side (the value).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Text Elements</h4>
<p>In the context of text processing, <strong>Text Element Nodes</strong> represent structural components of text. These nodes are used to understand and manipulate text documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paragraph Node</strong>: Represents a paragraph of text, which might contain child nodes for sentences or inline elements.</li>
<li><strong>Heading Node</strong>: Represents headings within a document, often with attributes for the heading level (e.g., H1, H2).</li>
<li><strong>Sentence Node</strong>: Represents individual sentences within a paragraph, which might contain child nodes for words or phrases.</li>
<li><strong>Inline Element Node</strong>: Represents inline text elements like bold or italic text, links, or images.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Edges</h3>
<p>Edges in an AST represent the relationships between nodes, forming a tree-like structure. They are crucial for understanding how different parts of the code or text are connected. Here's a more detailed look at how edges function within an AST:</p>
<h4>Function Edges</h4>
<p>In a function node, edges connect the function node to its child nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge from Function Node to Name Node</strong>: Represents the function's name.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Function Node to Arguments Node</strong>: Connects the function to its parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Function Node to Body Node</strong>: Links the function to its body, where the function's logic is defined.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Expression Edges</h4>
<p>Edges within expression nodes connect operands and operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge from Binary Operation Node to Left Operand</strong>: Connects the operation to its left operand.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Binary Operation Node to Right Operand</strong>: Connects the operation to its right operand.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Call Node to Function Name Node</strong>: Links the function call to the function being called.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Call Node to Arguments Node</strong>: Connects the function call to its arguments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Statement Edges</h4>
<p>Edges within statement nodes connect the statement to its components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge from If Node to Condition Node</strong>: Links the if statement to its condition.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from If Node to Body Node</strong>: Connects the if statement to its body.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Loop Node to Loop Condition Node</strong>: Links the loop to its condition.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Loop Node to Loop Body Node</strong>: Connects the loop to its body.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Text Element Edges</h4>
<p>Edges in text processing connect text elements to their sub-elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge from Paragraph Node to Sentence Node</strong>: Connects a paragraph to its sentences.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Sentence Node to Inline Element Node</strong>: Links a sentence to its inline elements.</li>
<li><strong>Edge from Heading Node to Text Node</strong>: Connects a heading to its text content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example of Node and Edge Relationships</h3>
<p>Consider the Python function example again:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">greet</span>(<span class="hljs-params">name</span>):
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f"Hello, <span class="hljs-subst">{name}</span>!"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The AST would have the following nodes and edges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Function Def Node</strong> (root):
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Name Node</strong> (<code>greet</code>).</li>
<li>Edge to <strong>Arguments Node</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Arg Node</strong> (<code>name</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edge to <strong>Body Node</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Expr Node</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Call Node</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Name Node</strong> (<code>print</code>).</li>
<li>Edge to <strong>Joined Str Node</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Formatted Value Node</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Edge to <strong>Name Node</strong> (<code>name</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edge to <strong>Str Node</strong> (<code>Hello, </code>).</li>
<li>Edge to <strong>Str Node</strong> (<code>!</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This detailed structure illustrates how nodes and edges work together to represent the hierarchical and relational aspects of the code.</p>
<p>In summary, nodes and edges are the core components of an AST, providing a structured and abstracted representation of code or text. Nodes represent the various elements, while edges define the relationships between these elements, allowing for a comprehensive understanding and manipulation of the source.</p>
