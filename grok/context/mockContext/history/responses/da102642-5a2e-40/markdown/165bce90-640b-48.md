## Components of an AST

An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is composed of various elements that together represent the syntactic structure of the source code or text. Let's delve deeper into the components mentioned: Nodes and Edges.

### Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of an AST. They represent different constructs within the source code or text, and each type of node serves a specific purpose. Here's a more detailed look at the different types of nodes:

#### Functions

**Function Nodes** represent function definitions in the code. They are crucial because they encapsulate the entire function, including its name, parameters, and body. For example, in Python, a function node for `def greet(name):` would include:

- **Name Node**: This node contains the name of the function, in this case, `greet`.
- **Arguments Node**: This node represents the function's parameters. It could contain child nodes like `arg` nodes for each parameter, such as an `arg` node for `name`.
- **Body Node**: This node represents the body of the function, which might contain multiple child nodes representing statements or expressions within the function.

#### Expressions

**Expression Nodes** represent operations or values within the code. They are used to denote various types of expressions, such as arithmetic operations, function calls, or variable references. For instance:

- **Binary Operation Node**: Represents operations like addition or subtraction, with child nodes for the left and right operands.
- **Call Node**: Represents function calls, such as the `print` function in `print(f"Hello, {name}!")`. It would have a child node for the function name and another for the arguments.
- **Literal Node**: Represents constant values like numbers or strings, such as `42` or `"Hello, World!"`.
- **Variable Node**: Represents references to variables, such as `name` in `greet(name)`.

#### Statements

**Statement Nodes** represent the control flow and structure of the code. They are essential for understanding the sequence of operations in a program. Examples include:

- **If Node**: Represents conditional statements, with child nodes for the condition, the body, and possibly an else clause.
- **Loop Node**: Represents loops like `for` or `while`, with child nodes for the loop condition, the loop body, and possibly initialization and update expressions.
- **Assignment Node**: Represents variable assignments, with child nodes for the left-hand side (the variable) and the right-hand side (the value).

#### Text Elements

In the context of text processing, **Text Element Nodes** represent structural components of text. These nodes are used to understand and manipulate text documents:

- **Paragraph Node**: Represents a paragraph of text, which might contain child nodes for sentences or inline elements.
- **Heading Node**: Represents headings within a document, often with attributes for the heading level (e.g., H1, H2).
- **Sentence Node**: Represents individual sentences within a paragraph, which might contain child nodes for words or phrases.
- **Inline Element Node**: Represents inline text elements like bold or italic text, links, or images.

### Edges

Edges in an AST represent the relationships between nodes, forming a tree-like structure. They are crucial for understanding how different parts of the code or text are connected. Here's a more detailed look at how edges function within an AST:

#### Function Edges

In a function node, edges connect the function node to its child nodes:

- **Edge from Function Node to Name Node**: Represents the function's name.
- **Edge from Function Node to Arguments Node**: Connects the function to its parameters.
- **Edge from Function Node to Body Node**: Links the function to its body, where the function's logic is defined.

#### Expression Edges

Edges within expression nodes connect operands and operators:

- **Edge from Binary Operation Node to Left Operand**: Connects the operation to its left operand.
- **Edge from Binary Operation Node to Right Operand**: Connects the operation to its right operand.
- **Edge from Call Node to Function Name Node**: Links the function call to the function being called.
- **Edge from Call Node to Arguments Node**: Connects the function call to its arguments.

#### Statement Edges

Edges within statement nodes connect the statement to its components:

- **Edge from If Node to Condition Node**: Links the if statement to its condition.
- **Edge from If Node to Body Node**: Connects the if statement to its body.
- **Edge from Loop Node to Loop Condition Node**: Links the loop to its condition.
- **Edge from Loop Node to Loop Body Node**: Connects the loop to its body.

#### Text Element Edges

Edges in text processing connect text elements to their sub-elements:

- **Edge from Paragraph Node to Sentence Node**: Connects a paragraph to its sentences.
- **Edge from Sentence Node to Inline Element Node**: Links a sentence to its inline elements.
- **Edge from Heading Node to Text Node**: Connects a heading to its text content.

### Example of Node and Edge Relationships

Consider the Python function example again:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

The AST would have the following nodes and edges:

- **Function Def Node** (root):
  - Edge to **Name Node** (`greet`).
  - Edge to **Arguments Node**:
    - Edge to **Arg Node** (`name`).
  - Edge to **Body Node**:
    - Edge to **Expr Node**:
      - Edge to **Call Node**:
        - Edge to **Name Node** (`print`).
        - Edge to **Joined Str Node**:
          - Edge to **Formatted Value Node**:
            - Edge to **Name Node** (`name`).
          - Edge to **Str Node** (`Hello, `).
          - Edge to **Str Node** (`!`).

This detailed structure illustrates how nodes and edges work together to represent the hierarchical and relational aspects of the code.

In summary, nodes and edges are the core components of an AST, providing a structured and abstracted representation of code or text. Nodes represent the various elements, while edges define the relationships between these elements, allowing for a comprehensive understanding and manipulation of the source.
