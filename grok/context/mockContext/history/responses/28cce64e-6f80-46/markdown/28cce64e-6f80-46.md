Here's an ASCII art representation of the architecture you described:

```
+------------------+
|    Client       |
|    Request      |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
|  NGINX Proxy    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+       +------------------+
| Node Express    |       | Node Express    |
| Server 1        |       | Server 2        |
+------------------+       +------------------+
         |                         |
         +-------------------------+
                         |
                         v
+------------------+
|    One Database |
|    for Node     |
|    Servers      |
+------------------+
```

This diagram illustrates the flow from a client request through an NGINX proxy to multiple Node.js Express servers, which then interact with a single database.
