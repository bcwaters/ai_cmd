        <h1>Regex Techniques for Text Tokenization in Machine Learning for LLMs</h1>
<p>In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning, text tokenization is a critical step in preparing text data for processing. Regular expressions (regex) can be powerful tools for tokenizing text effectively. Below are a few regex techniques that can be employed for this purpose:</p>
<h2>1. <strong>Word Tokenization</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most basic forms of tokenization is splitting text into individual words. This can be achieved with a simple regex pattern that matches sequences of word characters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "This is a sample text for tokenization.";
let words = text.match(/\b\w+\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["This", "is", "a", "sample", "text", "for", "tokenization"]
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\b</code> asserts a word boundary, ensuring that the match is a whole word.</li>
<li><code>\w+</code> matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, and underscores).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. <strong>Sentence Tokenization</strong></h2>
<p>Tokenizing text into sentences is crucial for tasks like sentiment analysis or summarization. A regex pattern can be used to identify sentence boundaries.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "Hello world! How are you today? I hope you're doing well.";
let sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]/g);
console.log(sentences);
// Output: ["Hello world!", "How are you today?", "I hope you're doing well."]
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[^.!?]+</code> matches one or more characters that are not a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.</li>
<li><code>[.!?]</code> matches any of the sentence-ending punctuation marks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. <strong>Tokenization with Punctuation</strong></h2>
<p>In some cases, it's important to keep punctuation as separate tokens, especially for models that need to understand the role of punctuation in language.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "Hello, world! How are you?";
let tokens = text.match(/\S+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["Hello,", "world!", "How", "are", "you?"]
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\S+</code> matches one or more non-whitespace characters, which includes punctuation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. <strong>Tokenization of Special Characters</strong></h2>
<p>For more complex tokenization, you might need to handle special characters or symbols separately, which can be important for tasks like code tokenization or processing text with emojis.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "Hello! How are you? #hashtag @mention ðŸ˜Š";
let tokens = text.match(/[\w#@]+|[^\w\s#@]+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["Hello", "!", "How", "are", "you", "?", "#hashtag", "@mention", "ðŸ˜Š"]
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[\w#@]+</code> matches one or more word characters, hashtags, or at symbols.</li>
<li><code>[^\w\s#@]+</code> matches one or more characters that are not word characters, whitespace, hashtags, or at symbols.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. <strong>Custom Tokenization for Specific Domains</strong></h2>
<p>In specialized domains like medical texts or legal documents, you might need to tokenize based on specific patterns. For instance, tokenizing medical terms or legal citations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with hypertension. See case law: Brown v. Board of Education.";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Z][a-z]+|[A-Z]+(?=[A-Z][a-z])|\d+(?=\s*v\.\s*)|[^\s]+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["The", "patient", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "hypertension", "See", "case", "law", "Brown", "v", "Board", "of", "Education"]
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[A-Z][a-z]+</code> matches capitalized words (e.g., "The", "patient").</li>
<li><code>[A-Z]+(?=[A-Z][a-z])</code> matches sequences of uppercase letters before a capitalized word (e.g., "Brown").</li>
<li><code>\d+(?=\s*v\.\s*)</code> matches numbers before "v." in legal citations.</li>
<li><code>[^\s]+</code> matches any non-whitespace sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>These regex techniques provide a foundation for text tokenization in machine learning, particularly when working with LLMs. They can be adjusted and combined to meet the specific needs of your text processing tasks.</p>

      <div title=""Regex Techniques" id="childContent1" onclick="setVisibileChild('childContent1')" hidden=true><h1>Regex Techniques in Word Tokenization</h1>
<p>Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool used in word tokenization to define patterns that help in breaking down text into tokens. Here's a more detailed look at how regex techniques are applied in word tokenization, building on the information previously provided:</p>
<h2>Pattern Matching for Word Boundaries</h2>
<p>Regex is particularly useful for identifying word boundaries. The pattern <code>\b\w+\b</code> is commonly used to match sequences of word characters bounded by word boundaries. This ensures that words are correctly identified and separated from punctuation and spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Example in JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with hypertension. The treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes.";
let words = text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["the", "patient", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "hypertension", "the", "treatment", "includes", "medication", "and", "lifestyle", "changes"]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the regex pattern <code>\b\w+\b</code> matches sequences of word characters (<code>\w+</code>) that are bounded by word boundaries (<code>\b</code>). This effectively splits the text into individual words.</p>
<h2>Handling Ambiguity with Flexible Patterns</h2>
<p>Regex patterns can be designed to handle ambiguous cases such as contractions. For instance, the pattern <code>\b\w+(?:'\w+)?\b</code> can be used to optionally include contractions as part of a single token.</p>
<p><strong>Example in JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "It's important to understand word tokenization.";
let words = text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+(?:'\w+)?\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["it's", "important", "to", "understand", "word", "tokenization"]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the regex pattern <code>\b\w+(?:'\w+)?\b</code> matches a word followed by an optional contraction (<code>(?:'\w+)?</code>). This allows for the correct tokenization of contractions like "it's" as a single token.</p>
<h2>Managing Special Characters and Punctuation</h2>
<p>Regex can also be used to handle special characters and punctuation. Depending on the requirements, punctuation can either be included as part of a token or separated from it. For example, to include periods as part of abbreviations, the pattern <code>\b[A-Z]+\.\b</code> can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Example in JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with hypertension. The treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes. The U.S.A. is a large country.";
let words = text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+(?:'\w+)?\b|\b[A-Z]+\.\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["the", "patient", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "hypertension", "the", "treatment", "includes", "medication", "and", "lifestyle", "changes", "u.s.a"]
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the regex pattern <code>\b\w+(?:'\w+)?\b|\b[A-Z]+\.\b</code> combines the pattern for general words and contractions with a pattern specifically for abbreviations ending in a period.</p>
<h2>Domain-Specific Regex Patterns</h2>
<p>For domain-specific terms, regex patterns can be tailored to recognize and handle them appropriately. For instance, in medical texts, a pattern like <code>\b[Cc][Oo][Pp][Dd]\b</code> can be used to recognize the term "COPD" as a single token.</p>
<p><strong>Example in JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with COPD.";
let words = text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+(?:'\w+)?\b|\b[Cc][Oo][Pp][Dd]\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["the", "patient", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "COPD"]
</code></pre>
<p>This pattern <code>\b[Cc][Oo][Pp][Dd]\b</code> ensures that "COPD" is treated as a single token, regardless of its capitalization.</p>
<p>By using regex techniques, word tokenization can be made more flexible and accurate, addressing various challenges such as ambiguity, special characters, and domain-specific terms.</p>

</div><div title=" Word Tokenization" id="childContent2" onclick="setVisibileChild('childContent2')" hidden=true><h1>Word Tokenization</h1>
<p>Word tokenization is a fundamental process in natural language processing (NLP) that involves breaking down a text into its constituent words or tokens. This step is crucial for many downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling. Here's a detailed exploration of word tokenization, building on the information already provided:</p>
<h2>Importance in Text Processing</h2>
<p>Word tokenization is essential for converting unstructured text into a format that can be more easily analyzed and processed by algorithms. By segmenting text into individual words, it becomes possible to perform operations such as counting word frequencies, identifying key terms, and understanding the syntactic structure of sentences.</p>
<h3>Example in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Here is a simple example of how word tokenization can be implemented in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with hypertension. The treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes.";
let words = text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["the", "patient", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "hypertension", "the", "treatment", "includes", "medication", "and", "lifestyle", "changes"]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the text is converted to lowercase and split into words using a regular expression that matches sequences of word characters bounded by word boundaries.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Strategies</h2>
<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Word tokenization can face challenges due to the ambiguity of certain characters. For instance, contractions like "don't" or "it's" can be tokenized as one word or split into two. Contextual analysis can help in deciding the appropriate tokenization method.</p>
<h3>Special Characters</h3>
<p>Handling special characters and punctuation is another challenge. In some cases, it might be necessary to include punctuation in tokens, while in others, it should be separated. For example, in the phrase "U.S.A.", the periods should be considered part of the token.</p>
<h3>Domain-Specific Terms</h3>
<p>In custom domains, word tokenization must be sensitive to domain-specific terms and abbreviations. For instance, in medical texts, terms like "COPD" should be treated as a single token rather than being split into individual characters.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Effective Word Tokenization</h2>
<h3>Contextual Analysis</h3>
<p>Using contextual analysis to determine the appropriate tokenization of ambiguous words or phrases can enhance accuracy. For example, understanding that "it's" should be split into "it" and "is" in certain contexts.</p>
<h3>Flexible Regex Patterns</h3>
<p>Designing regex patterns that can adapt to different scenarios is crucial. For example, using patterns that can handle both contractions and standard words:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "It's important to understand word tokenization.";
let words = text.toLowerCase().match(/\b[\w']+\b/g);
console.log(words);
// Output: ["it's", "important", "to", "understand", "word", "tokenization"]
</code></pre>
<h3>Domain-Specific Libraries</h3>
<p>Utilizing libraries or tools designed for specific domains can improve tokenization accuracy. For example, medical NLP libraries might have functions tailored to handle medical terminology and abbreviations.</p>
<p>By effectively managing word tokenization, the accuracy and utility of text processing in specialized fields can be significantly enhanced, ensuring that the unique aspects of these domains are preserved and leveraged.</p>

</div><div title=" Sentence Tokenization" id="childContent3" onclick="setVisibileChild('childContent3')" hidden=true><h1>Sentence Tokenization in Custom Domain Tokenization</h1>
<p>Sentence tokenization is a pivotal component of text processing, especially within the context of custom domain tokenization. This process involves the segmentation of text into individual sentences, which is crucial for understanding and analyzing the structure and semantics of specialized texts such as medical documents and legal texts.</p>
<h2>Importance in Specialized Domains</h2>
<h3>Medical Texts</h3>
<p>In medical texts, sentence tokenization is essential for accurately interpreting medical reports and records. For instance, a medical report might contain multiple sentences detailing different aspects of a patient's condition and treatment plan. Proper sentence tokenization ensures that each sentence is treated as a distinct unit, which is critical for subsequent analysis and processing. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with hypertension. The treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes.";
let sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]/g);
console.log(sentences);
// Output: ["The patient was diagnosed with hypertension.", "The treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes."]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the text is split into two sentences, allowing for clear delineation of the diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>
<h3>Legal Documents</h3>
<p>In legal documents, sentence tokenization is crucial for maintaining the structure and meaning of legal texts. Legal documents often contain complex sentences with multiple clauses, and accurate sentence tokenization ensures that each clause is correctly identified and can be analyzed independently. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The defendant shall pay the fine. The plaintiff shall receive compensation as per Â§234 of the code.";
let sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]/g);
console.log(sentences);
// Output: ["The defendant shall pay the fine.", "The plaintiff shall receive compensation as per Â§234 of the code."]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the text is divided into two sentences, ensuring that the obligations of the defendant and plaintiff are clearly separated.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Strategies</h2>
<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Sentence tokenization can be challenging due to the ambiguity of punctuation marks. For instance, a period can signify the end of a sentence or be part of an abbreviation. To address this, contextual analysis is essential. If a period follows a known abbreviation in medical texts, it should be treated as part of the abbreviation rather than as a sentence terminator.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>Ensuring consistency in sentence tokenization across different documents and contexts is another challenge. This requires the development of robust tokenization rules that can adapt to various scenarios. For instance, flexible regex patterns can help maintain consistency:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient has COPD. The treatment is ongoing.";
let sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]/g);
console.log(sentences);
// Output: ["The patient has COPD.", "The treatment is ongoing."]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the regex pattern accurately identifies the sentences, even when a period is part of an abbreviation.</p>
<h3>Regex Complexity</h3>
<p>Creating regex patterns that accurately capture sentences without over-tokenizing or missing important segments requires careful design. For instance, a pattern like <code>/[^.!?]+[.!?]/g</code> can be used to match sentences but needs to be refined to handle different use cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient's condition is stable. Refer to Â§123 for more details.";
let sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]/g);
console.log(sentences);
// Output: ["The patient's condition is stable.", "Refer to Â§123 for more details."]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the regex pattern successfully separates the text into two distinct sentences.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Effective Sentence Tokenization</h2>
<h3>Contextual Analysis</h3>
<p>Using context to determine the role of punctuation is essential for accurate sentence tokenization. For instance, if a period is part of an abbreviation, it should be treated differently than when it is a sentence terminator.</p>
<h3>Flexible Regex Patterns</h3>
<p>Design regex patterns that can be adjusted based on the domain's specific needs. This might involve using character classes or lookaheads to handle different scenarios.</p>
<h3>Domain-Specific Libraries</h3>
<p>Utilize libraries or tools designed for specific domains that handle sentence tokenization appropriately. For example, medical NLP libraries might have built-in functions for handling medical abbreviations and sentence structures.</p>
<p>By effectively managing sentence tokenization in custom domain tokenization, you can enhance the accuracy and utility of text processing in specialized fields, ensuring that the unique aspects of these domains are preserved and leveraged.</p>

</div><div title=" Punctuation Tokenization" id="childContent4" onclick="setVisibileChild('childContent4')" hidden=true><h1>Punctuation Tokenization in Custom Domain Tokenization</h1>
<p>Punctuation tokenization is a critical aspect of text processing, especially within the context of custom domain tokenization. This process involves the identification and separation of punctuation marks from the surrounding text, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and semantic meaning of specialized texts such as medical documents and legal texts.</p>
<h2>Importance in Specialized Domains</h2>
<h3>Medical Texts</h3>
<p>In medical texts, punctuation can be crucial for understanding the context and meaning of medical terminology. For instance, commas and semicolons can separate different diagnoses or treatments within a single sentence, ensuring that each element is clearly delineated. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient was diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes; treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes.";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Za-z]+|[,\s;]+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["The", "patient", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "hypertension", ",", "diabetes", ";", "treatment", "includes", "medication", "and", "lifestyle", "changes", "."]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the comma and semicolon are tokenized separately to ensure that each medical condition and treatment is clearly separated and can be processed individually.</p>
<h3>Legal Documents</h3>
<p>In legal documents, punctuation plays a vital role in structuring sentences and referencing specific parts of legal texts. For example, the use of periods, commas, and semicolons can affect the interpretation of legal clauses. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The defendant shall pay the fine, and the plaintiff shall receive compensation; see Â§234 of the code.";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Za-z]+|[,\s.;Â§]+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["The", "defendant", "shall", "pay", "the", "fine", ",", "and", "the", "plaintiff", "shall", "receive", "compensation", ";", "see", "Â§", "234", "of", "the", "code", "."]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the comma, semicolon, and section symbol (Â§) are tokenized separately to maintain the clarity and structure of the legal text.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Strategies</h2>
<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Punctuation can sometimes be ambiguous, depending on the context. For instance, a period can indicate the end of a sentence or be part of an abbreviation. To address this, contextual analysis is crucial. For example, if a period follows a known abbreviation in medical texts, it should be treated as part of the abbreviation rather than as a sentence terminator.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>Ensuring that punctuation is consistently tokenized across different documents and contexts is challenging. This requires the development of robust tokenization rules that can adapt to various scenarios. For instance, the use of flexible regex patterns can help in maintaining consistency:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient has COPD. The treatment is ongoing.";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Za-z]+|\./g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["The", "patient", "has", "COPD", ".", "The", "treatment", "is", "ongoing", "."]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the period is tokenized separately to ensure it can be identified as a sentence terminator or part of an abbreviation.</p>
<h3>Regex Complexity</h3>
<p>Creating regex patterns that accurately capture punctuation without over-tokenizing or missing important tokens requires careful design. For instance, a pattern like <code>/[,\s.;Â§]+/</code> can be used to match common punctuation marks, but it needs to be refined to handle different use cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient's condition is stable; refer to Â§123 for more details.";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Za-z]+|[,\s.;Â§]+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["The", "patient", "s", "condition", "is", "stable", ";", "refer", "to", "Â§", "123", "for", "more", "details", "."]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the semicolon and section symbol are tokenized separately to maintain their significance in the text.</p>

</div><div title=" Special Characters" id="childContent5" onclick="setVisibileChild('childContent5')" hidden=true><h1>Special Characters in Custom Domain Tokenization</h1>
<p>In the context of custom domain tokenization, particularly within specialized domains such as medical texts and legal documents, handling special characters is crucial for accurate text processing and analysis. Special characters can include symbols like &amp;, *, @, #, and others that have specific meanings or are part of domain-specific terminology.</p>
<h2>Importance of Special Characters</h2>
<p>Special characters often play a vital role in the structure and meaning of texts within specialized domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical Texts</strong>: In medical terminology, special characters might be used in abbreviations or to denote specific medical conditions or treatments. For example, the '@' symbol might be used in electronic health records to tag specific fields or data points.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Documents</strong>: Legal texts may use special characters in citations, such as '&amp;' in case names or '@' to denote email addresses in contact information. Additionally, symbols like Â§ (section) are crucial for referencing specific parts of legal codes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges in Tokenizing Special Characters</h2>
<p>Tokenizing special characters presents several challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambiguity</strong>: Special characters can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, the '&amp;' symbol could be part of a company name or a logical operator in a programming context.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ensuring that special characters are consistently tokenized across different documents and contexts is challenging, especially when dealing with variations in how these characters are used.</li>
<li><strong>Regex Complexity</strong>: Creating regex patterns that accurately capture special characters without over-tokenizing or missing important tokens requires careful design. For instance, a pattern like <code>/[&amp;@#Â§]/</code> might be used to match common special characters, but it needs to be refined to handle different use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of Special Character Tokenization</h2>
<h3>Medical Texts</h3>
<p>Consider the following medical text example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "The patient's condition is stable @last_check";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Za-z]+|[@]/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["The", "patient", "s", "condition", "is", "stable", "@", "last", "check"]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the '@' symbol is tokenized separately to ensure it can be recognized as a tag for further processing.</p>
<h3>Legal Documents</h3>
<p>For legal documents, consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "Refer to Â§123 of the code &amp; consult with Brown v. Board of Education";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Za-z]+|Â§\d+|\&amp;/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["Refer", "to", "Â§123", "of", "the", "code", "&amp;", "consult", "with", "Brown", "v", "Board", "of", "Education"]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the 'Â§' symbol and the '&amp;' are tokenized separately to maintain their significance in legal referencing.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Handling Special Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contextual Analysis</strong>: Use context to determine the role of special characters. For instance, if '&amp;' appears within a company name, it should be treated as part of the token rather than a separate entity.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Regex Patterns</strong>: Design regex patterns that can be adjusted based on the domain's specific needs. This might involve using character classes or lookaheads to handle different scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-Specific Libraries</strong>: Utilize libraries or tools designed for specific domains that handle special characters appropriately. For example, medical NLP libraries might have built-in functions for handling medical abbreviations.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>[A-Z][a-z]+</code> matches capitalized words, which are common in medical terminology. This pattern ensures that terms like "hypertension" are correctly identified as single tokens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legal Documents</h3>
<p>Legal texts often include citations and specific legal terminology that need to be tokenized separately. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let text = "See case law Brown v. Board of Education.";
let tokens = text.match(/[A-Z]+|[A-Z][a-z]+|\d+(?=\sv\.s\.v)|[^\s]+/g);
console.log(tokens);
// Output: ["See", "case", "law", "Brown", "v", "Board", "of", "Education"]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>[A-Z]+</code> matches sequences of uppercase letters, which is useful for identifying acronyms or capitalized names in legal citations.</li>
<li><code>[A-Z][a-z]+</code> captures capitalized words, which are common in legal terminology.</li>
<li><code>\d+(?=\sv\.s\.v)</code> matches numbers before "v." in legal citations, ensuring that case numbers are correctly tokenized.</li>
<li><code>[^\s]+</code> matches any non-whitespace sequence, which helps in capturing other elements in the text.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Importance of Custom Domain Tokenization</h2>
