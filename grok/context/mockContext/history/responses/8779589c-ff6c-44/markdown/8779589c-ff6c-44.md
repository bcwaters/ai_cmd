To create a sideways T in ASCII art, you can use the following characters:

```
|
- -
```

Here's how it looks when put together:

```
|
- - -
```

This represents a simple sideways T. You can adjust the length of the horizontal line (`-`) to make it wider if needed, or add more vertical lines (`|`) to make it taller, depending on your specific requirements.
