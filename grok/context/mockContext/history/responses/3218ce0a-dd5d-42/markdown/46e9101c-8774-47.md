## Set Up Unified Pipeline

### Introduction

Setting up a unified pipeline for LaTeX rendering is crucial for integrating and processing mathematical expressions seamlessly across your project. This step involves configuring your build process to handle LaTeX syntax effectively, ensuring that your documents or web content can display complex equations correctly.

### Detailed Configuration Steps

#### 1. **Understanding the Pipeline**

A unified pipeline refers to a series of automated steps that transform source files into the desired output format. For LaTeX rendering, this pipeline typically includes:

- **Source File Processing**: Parsing markdown or other source files that contain LaTeX expressions.
- **Conversion**: Using tools like Pandoc to convert these files into formats like HTML, PDF, or others.
- **Rendering**: Utilizing engines like MathJax to render LaTeX expressions within the output.

#### 2. **Configuring the Build Script**

To set up the pipeline, you need to create a build script. This script will automate the conversion and rendering process. Here's a more detailed example using a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for a CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml configuration
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  image: pandoc/latex
  script:
    - echo "Starting build process"
    - pandoc --mathjax --from=markdown --to=html --output=output.html input.md
    - echo "Build completed successfully"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output.html

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying output.html to server"
    - scp output.html user@server:/path/to/deploy
  only:
    - main
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `build_job` uses the `pandoc/latex` Docker image, which includes LaTeX and Pandoc.
  - The `pandoc` command converts the `input.md` file to `output.html`, using MathJax for LaTeX rendering.
  - The `artifacts` section ensures that the `output.html` file is saved as an artifact for further use.
  - The `deploy_job` deploys the `output.html` to a server, but only if the changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

#### 3. **Automating the Pipeline**

To automate the pipeline, you can use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions. Each of these tools allows you to define a series of steps that will run automatically when changes are pushed to your repository.

Here's an example using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Pandoc
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v2

      - name: Build HTML
        run: |
          pandoc --mathjax --from=markdown --to=html --output=output.html input.md

      - name: Deploy to Server
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SERVER_SSH_KEY }}
          source: "output.html"
          target: "/path/to/deploy"
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch.
  - It checks out the code, sets up Pandoc, builds the HTML file using Pandoc with MathJax, and then deploys it to a server using SCP.

#### 4. **Customizing the Pipeline**

Depending on your project's needs, you might want to customize the pipeline further:

- **Multiple Outputs**: If you need to generate multiple output formats (e.g., PDF, HTML), you can add additional steps to the pipeline:

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - pandoc --mathjax input.md -o output.html
    - pandoc --mathjax input.md -o output.pdf
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output.html
      - output.pdf
```

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to configure the pipeline dynamically. For example, you might want to switch between different MathJax configurations based on the environment:

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - if [ "$CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME" = "production" ]; then
        pandoc --mathjax --mathjax-config=mathjax-production.js input.md -o output.html
      else
        pandoc --mathjax --mathjax-config=mathjax-dev.js input.md -o output.html
      fi
```

#### 5. **Testing the Pipeline**

Before deploying the pipeline, it's essential to test it thoroughly:

- **Local Testing**: Run the pipeline locally to ensure it works as expected. You can use tools like `act` for GitHub Actions to simulate the workflow on your local machine.
- **CI/CD Testing**: Use the CI/CD system's test capabilities to run the pipeline and verify the output. For example, you can add a step to check if the output file is generated correctly:

```yaml
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - pandoc --mathjax input.md -o output.html
    - test -f output.html && echo "Output file generated successfully" || echo "Output file not found"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output.html
```

### Conclusion

Setting up a unified pipeline for LaTeX rendering involves careful configuration of your build process. By automating the conversion and rendering of LaTeX expressions, you ensure that your project can consistently and efficiently handle complex mathematical content. This setup not only streamlines your workflow but also enhances the quality and accessibility of your output.
