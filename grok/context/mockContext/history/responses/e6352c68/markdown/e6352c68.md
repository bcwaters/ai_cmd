# Understanding the Error: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module

The error message `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` indicates that you're attempting to use ES6 module syntax (`import`) in a CommonJS environment or outside of a module context. This typically happens in Node.js when you're trying to use `import` statements in a script that is not recognized as a module.

### Common Causes and Solutions:

1. **Using `import` in a CommonJS Script:**
   If your file is using the `.js` extension and you're trying to use `import` statements, Node.js by default treats `.js` files as CommonJS modules, which don't support `import` syntax natively. To fix this, you can either:
   - Use the `.mjs` extension for your file, which tells Node.js to treat the file as an ES module:
     ```javascript
     // Rename yourfile.js to yourfile.mjs
     import { something } from 'module';
     ```
   - Or, set `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file to tell Node.js to treat all `.js` files in the project as ES modules:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "module"
     }
     ```

2. **Running the Script Directly:**
   If you're running your script directly with Node.js (e.g., `node yourfile.js`), ensure that Node.js is configured to run ES modules. You can specify the module type when running the script:
   ```bash
   node --input-type=module yourfile.js
   ```

3. **Incorrect Module Resolution:**
   Ensure that any modules you're trying to import are correctly installed and accessible. Check your `node_modules` directory and your `package.json` for any discrepancies.

### Additional Notes:

- If you're using a build tool or bundler like Webpack or Rollup, ensure your configuration supports ES modules and is set up correctly.
- If you're transitioning from CommonJS to ES modules, be mindful of the differences in syntax and module resolution.
