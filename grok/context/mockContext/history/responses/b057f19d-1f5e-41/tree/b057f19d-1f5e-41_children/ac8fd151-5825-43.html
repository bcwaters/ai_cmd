<h2>Other Solomon Mentions</h2>
<p>In addition to the books of Kings, Chronicles, and the wisdom literature directly attributed to Solomon, there are other mentions of Solomon in the Bible that provide further context to his life and reign. These references, primarily found in the Psalms, offer insights into the broader impact of his rule and the theological significance of his actions.</p>
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<p><strong>Psalm 72:1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse is traditionally understood as a prayer for Solomon, attributed to David. It reflects the hope that Solomon would rule with divine justice and righteousness, which aligns with the biblical portrayal of Solomon's early reign as one marked by wisdom and justice. This prayer underscores the expectation that Solomon's governance would be a continuation of the divine covenant with David, emphasizing the importance of righteous rule in maintaining the stability and prosperity of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 127:1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This psalm is often attributed to Solomon, though the text itself does not explicitly mention him. It speaks to the futility of human efforts without divine guidance and protection, a theme that resonates with Solomon's own experiences. The mention of building a house can be seen as a direct reference to Solomon's construction of the Temple, which was a significant achievement of his reign. The psalm emphasizes that even monumental projects like the Temple are ultimately dependent on God's blessing and involvement.</p>
