Here are two vegetables:

1. **Carrot**
   - Carrots are root vegetables, typically orange in color, though they can also be found in purple, red, white, and yellow varieties. They are rich in beta-carotene, which is converted into vitamin A in the body, supporting good vision, skin health, and immune function.

2. **Broccoli**
   - Broccoli is a member of the cabbage family and is known for its green, tree-like florets. It's packed with vitamins C and K, and also contains a good amount of fiber, making it beneficial for digestion and overall health.
