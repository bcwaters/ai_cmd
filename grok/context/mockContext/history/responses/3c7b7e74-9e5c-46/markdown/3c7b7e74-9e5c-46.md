Here is how you can represent the `grep` command with multiple files and an additional flag in the specified format:

```bash
grep pattern file.txt file2.txt --anotherFlagForGrep
```

This command will search for the specified `pattern` in `file.txt` and `file2.txt`, using the additional flag `--anotherFlagForGrep` to modify the grep behavior as needed.
