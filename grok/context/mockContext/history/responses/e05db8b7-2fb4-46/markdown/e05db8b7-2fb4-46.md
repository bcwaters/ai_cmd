# Understanding LaTeX Syntax and marked-katex-extension

The given LaTeX syntax represents the definition of the derivative of a function $f$ at a point $x$. It is written as:

```latex
f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
```

This LaTeX code uses several key elements:

- `f'(x)` represents the derivative of the function $f$ with respect to $x$.
- `\lim_{{h \to 0}}` denotes the limit as $h$ approaches 0.
- `\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}` is the difference quotient used to define the derivative.

Regarding the **marked-katex-extension**, it is designed to handle LaTeX syntax within Markdown documents. The marked-katex-extension should be able to render this LaTeX expression correctly, as it supports standard LaTeX syntax for mathematical expressions. Here's how it would typically be used in a Markdown document:

```markdown
$f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$
```

When processed by the marked-katex-extension, this Markdown should render the LaTeX expression into a formatted mathematical equation.
