Here are five fundamental proofs in geometry, presented in LaTeX for clarity:

### 1. Pythagorean Theorem

**Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$). Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

**Proof:**

Consider a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$. Construct squares on each of the three sides of the triangle. The area of the square on the hypotenuse is $c^2$. Now, rearrange four copies of the triangle to form a larger square with side length $a + b$. The area of this larger square is $(a + b)^2$. The area of the larger square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares plus the areas of the four triangles. Therefore:
\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}ab \]
\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab \]
Equating the two expressions for the area of the larger square, we get:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

### 2. Angle Sum Property of a Triangle

**Theorem:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$.

**Proof:**

Consider a triangle $ABC$. Draw a line parallel to $BC$ through point $A$. Let this line intersect the extensions of $AB$ and $AC$ at points $D$ and $E$, respectively. Since $DE \parallel BC$, the angles $\angle DAB$ and $\angle BCA$ are equal, and the angles $\angle EAC$ and $\angle ACB$ are equal. The straight line $DE$ forms a straight angle, which is $180^\circ$. Therefore:
\[ \angle DAB + \angle BAC + \angle EAC = 180^\circ \]
Substituting the equal angles, we get:
\[ \angle BCA + \angle BAC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ \]

### 3. Isosceles Triangle Theorem

**Theorem:** If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite those sides are equal.

**Proof:**

Consider an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$. Draw the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, intersecting $BC$ at point $D$. Since $AB = AC$, triangle $ABD$ is congruent to triangle $ACD$ by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) criterion. Therefore, the angles $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$ are equal. Since $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$ are also the angles opposite sides $AC$ and $AB$, respectively, we have:
\[ \angle ABC = \angle ACB \]

### 4. Exterior Angle Theorem

**Theorem:** The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

**Proof:**

Consider a triangle $ABC$ with an exterior angle at vertex $C$ formed by extending side $BC$ to point $D$. The exterior angle $\angle ACD$ is supplementary to the interior angle $\angle ACB$. Therefore:
\[ \angle ACD = 180^\circ - \angle ACB \]
The sum of the interior angles of triangle $ABC$ is $180^\circ$, so:
\[ \angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ \]
Rearranging, we get:
\[ \angle BAC + \angle ABC = 180^\circ - \angle ACB \]
Substituting this into the expression for the exterior angle, we get:
\[ \angle ACD = \angle BAC + \angle ABC \]

### 5. Midsegment Theorem

**Theorem:** The segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

**Proof:**

Consider a triangle $ABC$ with midpoints $D$ and $E$ of sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively. Draw segment $DE$. Since $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $AD = DB$ and $AE = EC$. Draw lines $DF$ and $EG$ parallel to $BC$ through $D$ and $E$, respectively, intersecting at point $F$ on $AB$ extended and point $G$ on $AC$ extended. Since $DF \parallel BC$ and $EG \parallel BC$, triangles $ADF$ and $BCE$ are similar to triangle $ABC$. Therefore, $DE$ is parallel to $BC$ and:
\[ DE = \frac{1}{2}BC \]

These proofs illustrate the fundamental principles of geometry, showcasing how geometric properties can be rigorously established.
