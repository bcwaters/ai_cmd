Here are the LaTeX examples from the previous response, showcasing various mathematical and algorithmic concepts:

### Softmax Function
The softmax function can be represented as:
$$
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{x_j}}
$$
where $x_i$ represents the $i$-th element of the input vector.

### Summation
A simple summation can be written as:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n+1}2
$$

### Trigonometric Functions
The Pythagorean identity can be represented as:
$$
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
$$

### Big O Notation
Big O notation for an algorithm's time complexity can be written as:
$$
O(n \log n)
$$

### Sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function can be represented as:
$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

### Batch Normalization
The formula for batch normalization can be written as:
$$
\hat{x} = \frac{x - E[x]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x] + \epsilon}}
$$

### Gradient Descent
The update rule for gradient descent can be represented as:
$$
\theta = \theta - \alpha 
abla_\theta J(\theta)
$$

### Jacobian Matrix
The Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function can be written as:
$$
\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

These examples showcase various mathematical and algorithmic concepts using inline LaTeX notation, which is widely used in fields like machine learning, theoretical computer science, and mathematics.
