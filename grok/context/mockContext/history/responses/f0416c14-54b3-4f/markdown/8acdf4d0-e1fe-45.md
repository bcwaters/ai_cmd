# Week 3: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

## Day 1: Exponential Functions

### Objective:
The primary goal of this day is to ensure that students gain a deep understanding of the properties and graphical representations of exponential functions. This includes recognizing exponential growth and decay patterns.

### Materials:
- **Graphing Calculators:** Essential for plotting exponential functions and observing their behavior.
- **Whiteboard:** Used for demonstrations and interactive discussions.

### Activities:

#### Introduction to Exponential Growth and Decay
- **Lecture:** Begin with a detailed explanation of exponential functions. Highlight the difference between exponential growth ($f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $b > 1$) and exponential decay ($f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $0 < b < 1$). Use real-world examples like population growth or radioactive decay to illustrate these concepts.
- **Graphing:** Use graphing calculators to plot various exponential functions. Encourage students to explore how changing the base $b$ affects the graph. For instance, plot $f(x) = 2^x$, $f(x) = 3^x$, and $f(x) = (1/2)^x$ to visualize growth and decay.

#### Analysis of Behavior
- **Class Discussion:** Discuss the end behavior of exponential functions. For growth functions, as $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x)$ also approaches infinity. For decay functions, as $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x)$ approaches zero.
- **Practice:** Students are given a set of exercises where they must graph exponential functions and describe their behavior in terms of growth or decay, intercepts, and asymptotes.

## Day 2: Logarithmic Functions

### Objective:
To familiarize students with the properties and graphs of logarithmic functions, as well as their applications in solving equations.

### Materials:
- **Graphing Calculators:** To help students visualize logarithmic functions.
- **Whiteboard:** For teaching and group discussions.

### Activities:

#### Introduction to Logarithms
- **Lecture:** Introduce the concept of logarithms, explaining that they are the inverse of exponential functions. Define logarithms using the equation $y = \log_b(x)$ which is equivalent to $b^y = x$. Cover the properties of logarithms, such as $\log_b(1) = 0$, $\log_b(b) = 1$, and the change of base formula $\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}$.
- **Graphing:** Demonstrate how to graph logarithmic functions on graphing calculators. Show the graphs of $y = \log_2(x)$, $y = \log_{10}(x)$ (common log), and $y = \ln(x)$ (natural log) to illustrate different bases.

#### Solving Logarithmic Equations
- **Practice:** Students work on exercises involving solving logarithmic equations. Examples include solving for $x$ in equations like $\log_2(x) = 3$ and $\log(x) + \log(2) = 1$.

## Day 3: Exponential and Logarithmic Equations

### Objective:
To equip students with the skills necessary to solve equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions.

### Materials:
- **Whiteboard:** For step-by-step demonstrations.
- **Worksheets:** Containing various problems for students to practice.

### Activities:

#### Solving Exponential Equations
- **Demonstration:** Show how to solve exponential equations using various techniques, such as taking the logarithm of both sides. For example, solve $2^x = 8$ by recognizing that $8 = 2^3$, so $x = 3$. Also, demonstrate solving $3^x = 10$ by taking the logarithm of both sides: $x = \log_3(10) = \frac{\log(10)}{\log(3)}$.
- **Practice:** Students solve a series of exponential equations, applying the techniques demonstrated.

#### Solving Logarithmic Equations
- **Demonstration:** Illustrate how to solve logarithmic equations, such as $\log_2(x) + \log_2(3) = 2$, by using properties of logarithms to simplify and solve for $x$.
- **Practice:** Students work through a set of logarithmic equations, ensuring they understand how to apply the properties of logarithms to find solutions.

## Day 4: Applications of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

### Objective:
To apply exponential and logarithmic functions to real-world problems, demonstrating their practical relevance.

### Materials:
- **Worksheets:** Containing real-world application problems.
- **Calculators:** For solving numerical problems.

### Activities:

#### Real-World Applications
- **Discussion:** Introduce real-world applications of exponential and logarithmic functions. Examples include:
  - **Compound Interest:** Explain how $A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$ models the growth of an investment, where $A$ is the amount of money accumulated after $n$ years, including interest, $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the annual interest rate (decimal), $n$ is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and $t$ is the time the money is invested for in years.
  - **pH Levels:** Discuss how pH is calculated using the logarithmic function $pH = -\log[H^+]$, where $[H^+]$ is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter.
- **Problem Solving:** Students solve a variety of problems related to these applications. For instance, calculate the future value of an investment using the compound interest formula or determine the pH of a solution given its hydrogen ion concentration.

## Day 5: Review and Assessment

### Objective:
To review the key concepts covered throughout the week and assess students' understanding through a quiz.

### Materials:
- **Review Sheets:** Summarizing the main points and formulas.
- **Quiz:** To test students' comprehension.

### Activities:

#### Review
- **Class Discussion:** Go over the main concepts of exponential and logarithmic functions, including their properties, graphs, and applications. Use the review sheets to guide the discussion, ensuring all key points are covered.
- **Q&A Session:** Allow time for students to ask questions about any topics they find challenging.

#### Assessment
- **Quiz:** Administer a short quiz to assess students' understanding of exponential and logarithmic functions. The quiz should include problems on graphing, solving equations, and applying these functions to real-world scenarios.

This detailed exploration of Week 3's curriculum on Exponential and Logarithmic Functions ensures that students not only understand the theoretical aspects but also see the practical applications, reinforcing their learning through varied and engaging activities.
