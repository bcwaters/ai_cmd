# Week 2: Trigonometry and Conic Sections

## Day 1: Introduction to Trigonometry

### Objective
The primary goal of this day is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of trigonometry, focusing on the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Students should be able to understand and apply these functions to solve basic trigonometric problems.

### Materials
- **Trigonometric tables:** Essential for students to look up trigonometric values without calculators.
- **Calculators:** Useful for verifying calculations and solving more complex problems.

### Activities

#### Introduction to Trigonometric Functions
- **Lecture:** Begin with a detailed explanation of the basic trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent. Define each function in terms of ratios of the sides of a right triangle (e.g., $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$).
- **Real-World Examples:** Use examples such as the height of a building or the angle of elevation to illustrate how these functions are used in practical scenarios.

#### Using Trigonometric Tables and Calculators
- **Demonstration:** Show students how to use trigonometric tables to find values of sine, cosine, and tangent for given angles. Emphasize the importance of understanding how to read these tables.
- **Calculator Use:** Demonstrate how to use a scientific calculator to find trigonometric values. Explain the difference between degree and radian mode and when to use each.

#### Problem Solving
- **Practice:** Students are given a set of exercises where they must use trigonometric tables and calculators to solve for unknown sides or angles in right triangles. Examples include finding the height of a tree given the angle of elevation and the distance from the base, or solving for an angle given two sides of a triangle.

## Day 2: Trigonometric Identities

### Objective
To teach students how to use and apply basic trigonometric identities, such as the Pythagorean identities and co-function identities, to solve trigonometric problems.

### Materials
- **Whiteboard:** Used for demonstrations and interactive problem-solving sessions.
- **Worksheets:** Containing various problems for students to practice applying trigonometric identities.

### Activities

#### Introduction to Trigonometric Identities
- **Lecture:** Introduce the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$ and explain its derivation from the Pythagorean theorem. Also, introduce co-function identities like $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)$.
- **Examples:** Provide examples of how these identities can be used to simplify expressions or solve equations, such as $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$ to find $\sin(\theta)$ given $\cos(\theta)$.

#### Applying Trigonometric Identities
- **Practice:** Students work on worksheets that involve using the Pythagorean and co-function identities to solve problems. Examples include simplifying expressions like $\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ using identities and solving equations like $\sin^2(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$.

## Day 3: Conic Sections - Circles and Parabolas

### Objective
To familiarize students with the equations and graphs of circles and parabolas, enabling them to identify key features and graph these conic sections.

### Materials
- **Graphing calculators:** Essential for plotting the graphs of circles and parabolas.
- **Whiteboard:** Used for demonstrations and interactive discussions.

### Activities

#### Introduction to Circles and Parabolas
- **Lecture:** Introduce the standard form of a circle's equation $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius. Also, introduce the standard form of a parabola's equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$ or $x = a(y - k)^2 + h$.
- **Graphing:** Demonstrate how to graph circles and parabolas using graphing calculators. Show how changing the parameters affects the shape and position of the graph.

#### Analysis of Key Features
- **Class Discussion:** Discuss the key features of circles and parabolas, such as the center, radius, vertex, focus, and directrix.
- **Practice:** Students are given exercises to graph circles and parabolas and identify their key features. Examples include graphing a circle given its equation and finding the vertex and focus of a parabola given its equation.

## Day 4: Conic Sections - Ellipses and Hyperbolas

### Objective
To introduce students to the equations and graphs of ellipses and hyperbolas, and to teach them how to analyze and graph these conic sections.

### Materials
- **Graphing calculators:** Necessary for plotting the graphs of ellipses and hyperbolas.
- **Whiteboard:** Used for teaching and group discussions.

### Activities

#### Introduction to Ellipses and Hyperbolas
- **Lecture:** Introduce the standard form of an ellipse's equation $\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ and a hyperbola's equation $\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1$.
- **Graphing:** Demonstrate how to graph ellipses and hyperbolas using graphing calculators. Show how changing the parameters affects the shape and orientation of the graph.

#### Analysis of Key Features
- **Class Discussion:** Discuss the key features of ellipses and hyperbolas, such as the center, foci, major and minor axes, and asymptotes.
- **Practice:** Students are given exercises to graph ellipses and hyperbolas and identify their key features. Examples include graphing an ellipse given its equation and finding the foci and asymptotes of a hyperbola given its equation.

## Day 5: Review and Assessment

### Objective
To review the key concepts covered throughout the week and assess students' understanding through a quiz.

### Materials
- **Review sheets:** Summarizing the main points and formulas covered during the week.
- **Quiz:** To test students' comprehension of trigonometry and conic sections.

### Activities

#### Review
- **Class Discussion:** Go over the main concepts of trigonometry and conic sections, including trigonometric functions, identities, and the equations and graphs of circles, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Use the review sheets to guide the discussion, ensuring all key points are covered.
- **Q&A Session:** Allow time for students to ask questions about any topics they find challenging.

#### Assessment
- **Quiz:** Administer a short quiz to assess students' understanding of the week's topics. The quiz should include problems on using trigonometric functions and identities, graphing and analyzing conic sections, and applying these concepts to solve problems.

This detailed exploration of Week 2's curriculum on Trigonometry and Conic Sections ensures that students not only understand the theoretical aspects but also see the practical applications, reinforcing their learning through varied and engaging activities.
