# Week 1: Introduction to Functions and Graphs

## Day 1: Introduction to Functions

### Objective
The primary goal of this day is to ensure that students understand the fundamental concept of a function and its notation. By the end of the day, students should be able to identify functions from various representations and use function notation correctly.

### Materials
- **Whiteboard:** Essential for demonstrations and interactive discussions.
- **Markers:** Used to write on the whiteboard during the lecture and discussions.
- **Graph Paper:** Useful for students to practice drawing functions manually.

### Activities

#### Discuss the Definition of a Function
- **Lecture:** Begin with a detailed explanation of what constitutes a function. Emphasize that a function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. Use the formal definition: A function $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in $A$ exactly one element $y$ in $B$, denoted as $f(x) = y$.
- **Examples:** Provide concrete examples such as $f(x) = 2x + 3$, and explain how each input $x$ results in a unique output $y$.

#### Introduce Function Notation and Examples
- **Lecture:** Explain function notation, such as $f(x)$, and how it is used to represent the output of a function for a given input. Discuss common notations like $f(x)$, $g(x)$, and $h(x)$.
- **Examples:** Use simple functions like $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$ to illustrate how to use function notation. Show how to evaluate functions, for instance, $f(2) = 2^2 = 4$.
- **Real-World Examples:** Use practical examples to illustrate functions, such as the cost of an item as a function of quantity purchased, $C(q) = 5q$, where $C$ is the total cost and $q$ is the quantity.

#### Practice Identifying Functions from Sets of Ordered Pairs and Graphs
- **Class Activity:** Present students with sets of ordered pairs and ask them to determine if they represent functions. For example, $\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\}$ is a function, but $\{(1, 2), (1, 3)\}$ is not because the input $1$ has two outputs.
- **Graphical Representation:** Use the whiteboard to draw graphs and explain the vertical line test. If a vertical line can be drawn anywhere on the graph and it touches the graph at only one point, then the graph represents a function.
- **Worksheet:** Distribute a worksheet with exercises where students must identify functions from given sets of ordered pairs and graphs. Examples include:
  - Determine if the set of points $\left\{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)\right\}$ represents a function.
  - Use the vertical line test on a graph to check if it represents a function.

By the end of Day 1, students should have a solid understanding of what a function is, how to use function notation, and be able to identify functions from various representations.
