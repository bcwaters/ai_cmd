Here are examples of "Hello World" programs in two different programming languages:

### Python

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

These examples demonstrate how to output the classic "Hello, World!" message in Python and JavaScript, respectively.
