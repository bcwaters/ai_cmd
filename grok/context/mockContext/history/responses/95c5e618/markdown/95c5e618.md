To trim a video using FFmpeg, you can specify the start time and duration of the segment you want to keep. Here's how you can do it:

### Trimming a Video with FFmpeg

You can trim a video by specifying the start time and either the duration or the end time. Here are the basic commands:

#### Using Start Time and Duration

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:10 -t 00:00:20 -c copy output.mp4
```

- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input file.
- `-ss 00:00:10`: Sets the start time to 10 seconds into the video.
- `-t 00:00:20`: Sets the duration of the output to 20 seconds.
- `-c copy`: Copies the codecs without re-encoding, which is faster but might not be precise.

#### Using Start Time and End Time

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:10 -to 00:00:30 -c copy output.mp4
```

- `-to 00:00:30`: Sets the end time to 30 seconds into the video.

#### Notes

- If you need more precision, you can remove `-c copy` to re-encode the video, but this will take longer.
- The `-ss` option can be placed before or after `-i`. Placing it before `-i` is faster but less accurate, while placing it after `-i` is slower but more accurate.

### Example

If you want to trim a video starting from 1 minute and 30 seconds into the video and lasting for 45 seconds:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:01:30 -t 00:00:45 -c copy output.mp4
```

This command will create a new video file `output.mp4` that starts at 1 minute and 30 seconds into the original video and lasts for 45 seconds.
