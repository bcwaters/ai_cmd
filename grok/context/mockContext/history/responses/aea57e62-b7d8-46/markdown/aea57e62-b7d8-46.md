# 10th Grade Trigonometry Lesson Plan: Unit Circle and Trigonometric Functions

**Lesson Objective:**  
Students will understand the concept of the unit circle and how it relates to trigonometric functions, specifically sine, cosine, and tangent. They will learn to use the unit circle to find exact values of trigonometric functions for common angles and apply these concepts to solve problems.

**Materials:**  
- Whiteboard and markers
- Trigonometry textbooks
- Scientific calculators
- Worksheets on unit circle trigonometry
- Rulers and protractors

**Introduction (10 minutes):**  
Begin by reviewing the basic trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) from the right triangle context. Introduce the unit circle as a tool for extending these concepts to all angles.

**Direct Instruction (20 minutes):**  
Define the unit circle as a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate plane. Explain how angles in standard position are measured and how they relate to the coordinates on the unit circle.

- Sine of an angle \(\theta\) is defined as the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle: \(\sin(\theta) = y\).
- Cosine of an angle \(\theta\) is defined as the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle: \(\cos(\theta) = x\).
- Tangent of an angle \(\theta\) is defined as the ratio of the sine to the cosine: \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\).

Demonstrate how to use the unit circle to find exact values of \(\sin(\theta)\), \(\cos(\theta)\), and \(\tan(\theta)\) for common angles such as \(0^\circ\), \(30^\circ\), \(45^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\).

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**  
Work through several examples on the board, showing how to determine the coordinates on the unit circle and calculate trigonometric values.

- Example: Find \(\sin(45^\circ)\), \(\cos(45^\circ)\), and \(\tan(45^\circ)\) using the unit circle.
  - The coordinates for \(45^\circ\) on the unit circle are \(\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\).
  - \(\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)
  - \(\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)
  - \(\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1\)

**Independent Practice (20 minutes):**  
Distribute worksheets for students to practice finding exact values of trigonometric functions using the unit circle. Encourage the use of calculators to verify their work.

**Real-World Application (10 minutes):**  
Discuss how the unit circle is used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics. Provide examples of how understanding the unit circle can help in solving problems related to periodic phenomena.

**Formative Assessment (5 minutes):**  
Conduct a quick quiz or exit ticket to assess students' understanding of using the unit circle to find trigonometric values.

- Questions could include finding \(\sin(\theta)\), \(\cos(\theta)\), and \(\tan(\theta)\) for specific angles.

**Summative Assessment (Homework):**  
Assign problems that require students to apply the unit circle to more complex scenarios, including finding trigonometric values for angles in different quadrants and solving word problems.

**Extension Activities:**  
For advanced students, introduce the concept of radian measure and how it relates to the unit circle. Encourage exploration of trigonometric identities and their proofs.

**Conclusion (5 minutes):**  
Recap the lesson's key points: the definition of the unit circle, how to use it to find exact values of trigonometric functions, and its applications. Highlight the importance of the unit circle in understanding trigonometry and encourage further exploration.
