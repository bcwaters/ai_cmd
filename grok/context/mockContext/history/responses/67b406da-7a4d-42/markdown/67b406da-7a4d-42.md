# Calculation of 2 plus 2 plus 5 times 7

To solve this, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets**: There are none.
2. **Exponents/Orders**: There are none.
3. **Multiplication and Division**: Calculate `5 times 7` first.
   \[
   5 \times 7 = 35
   \]
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Now add the results of the multiplication to the other numbers.
   \[
   2 + 2 + 35 = 39
   \]

So, the result of \(2 + 2 + 5 \times 7\) is:

\[
\boxed{39}
\]
