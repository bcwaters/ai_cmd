# Order of Operation for `for...of` Loop

The `for...of` loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc. The order of operation for a `for...of` loop can be described as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts by setting up the iterable object `y`. The variable `x` is declared within the loop and will take on the value of each element in `y` during each iteration.

2. **Iteration**: The loop iterates over `y` in the following order:
   - For an **array**, it iterates over the elements in the order they are defined in the array, from the first element (index 0) to the last element.
   - For a **string**, it iterates over each character in the string from left to right.
   - For a **Map**, it iterates over the key-value pairs in the order they were inserted.
   - For a **Set**, it iterates over the values in the order they were inserted.

3. **Assignment**: In each iteration, the next value from `y` is assigned to `x`.

4. **Execution**: The code block inside the loop is executed with the current value of `x`.

5. **Termination**: The loop continues until all elements in `y` have been iterated over, at which point the loop terminates.

Here is a simple example to illustrate the order of operation:

```javascript
let y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let x of y) {
    console.log(x);
}
```

In this example, the output will be:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

The loop iterates over the array `y`, assigning each element to `x` in order and executing the `console.log(x)` statement for each value of `x`.
