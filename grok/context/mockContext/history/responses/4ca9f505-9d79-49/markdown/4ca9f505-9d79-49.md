Here are some examples of LaTeX equations, both inline and in code blocks:

### Inline LaTeX Equations

- The Pythagorean theorem can be written as \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
- Einstein's mass-energy equivalence is given by \( E = mc^2 \).
- The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
- The area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \).

### LaTeX Equations in Code Blocks

```latex
% Pythagorean Theorem
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

% Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence
\[ E = mc^2 \]

% Quadratic Formula
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

% Area of a Circle
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]
```

These examples demonstrate how to include mathematical expressions in both inline and block formats using LaTeX syntax within Markdown.
