# Mathematical Equations

## Number Theory

- **Sum of Numbers Divisible by 3:**
  If \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) are integers divisible by 3, then each \( a_i \) can be written as:
  \[
  a_i = 3k_i
  \]
  where \( k_i \) is an integer. The sum of these numbers is:
  \[
  S = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 3k_1 + 3k_2 + \cdots + 3k_n
  \]
  Factoring out the 3, we get:
  \[
  S = 3(k_1 + k_2 + \cdots + k_n)
  \]
  Let \( t = k_1 + k_2 + \cdots + k_n \), which is an integer. Therefore:
  \[
  S = 3t
  \]
  Since \( S \) is expressed as 3 times an integer, \( S \) is divisible by 3.

## Algebra

- **Quadratic Equation:**
  The general form of a quadratic equation is:
  \[
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0
  \]
  The solutions to this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]

- **Pythagorean Theorem:**
  For a right triangle with legs \( a \) and \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the relationship between the sides is given by:
  \[
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  \]

## Calculus

- **Derivative:**
  The derivative of a function \( f(x) \) is denoted as \( f'(x) \) and represents the rate of change of \( f \) with respect to \( x \). For example, the derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 \) is:
  \[
  f'(x) = 2x
  \]

- **Integral:**
  The integral of a function \( f(x) \) represents the area under the curve of \( f(x) \). The indefinite integral of \( f(x) = x^2 \) is:
  \[
  \int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
  \]
  where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

## Physics

- **Einstein's Equation:**
  Einstein's famous equation relating mass and energy is:
  \[
  E = mc^2
  \]
  where \( E \) is energy, \( m \) is mass, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

- **Newton's Second Law:**
  Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:
  \[
  F = ma
  \]
  where \( F \) is force, \( m \) is mass, and \( a \) is acceleration.
