Here's my attempt at recreating a 3D ASCII art representation of Grok:

```
       /\
      /  \
     /____\
    /      \
   /        \
  /__________\
  |  ____  |
  | |    | |
  | |____| |
  |________|
   |     |
  /|     |\
 / |     | \
/  |     |  \
|  |     |  |
|  |     |  |
|  |     |  |
|  |_____|  |
|___________|
```

This ASCII art tries to capture Grok's head shape, eyes, and body in a simple 3D style. The head is represented by the top triangular shapes, with the eyes as the smaller triangles within. The body is shown as a rectangular prism, with some depth added by the angled lines at the bottom.

Let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments or if you have any other ASCII art requests!
