To run the `execSync` command as a shell call without passing it as a code parameter, you can modify the JavaScript to directly execute a shell command. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

try {
    // Execute the command directly as a shell command
    const result = execSync(`node ../grok/grok.js "hi grok this is a test prompt"`, { encoding: 'utf-8' });
    
    // Write the result to a file
    const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt');
    fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, result);

    // Send the file back to the client
    res.download(outputPath, 'output.txt');
} catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(`Error executing code: ${error.message}`);
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove the `-e` flag**: The `-e` flag in Node.js is used to evaluate a string as JavaScript code. Since you're now running a direct shell command, you don't need this flag.

2. **Direct Shell Command**: The command `node ../grok/grok.js "hi grok this is a test prompt"` will be executed directly in the shell. Make sure the path to `grok.js` is correct relative to where this script is running.

3. **Error Handling**: The `try-catch` block remains to handle any errors that might occur during the execution of the shell command.

**Usage:**

- Ensure that `grok.js` exists at the specified path (`../grok/grok.js`).
- The script will run `grok.js` with the argument `"hi grok this is a test prompt"`.
- The output of `grok.js` will be captured, written to `output.txt`, and then sent to the client for download.

This approach allows you to execute a shell command directly without needing a code parameter in the request.
