1. **Softmax Function**
   The softmax function is often used in machine learning, particularly in classification problems to convert a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution.

   text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^k e^{x_j}}

2. **Exponential Function**
   The exponential function is a fundamental function in mathematics used extensively in various fields including physics, finance, and biology.

   e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}

3. **Vector Normalization**
   Vector normalization is a process to convert a vector into a unit vector, which is useful in many applications such as computer graphics and machine learning.

   \hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}

4. **Pythagorean Theorem**
   The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.

   a^2 + b^2 = c^2

5. **Quadratic Formula**
   The quadratic formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
