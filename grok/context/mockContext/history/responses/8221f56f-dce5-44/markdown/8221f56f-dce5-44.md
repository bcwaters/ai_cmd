Here's how to represent the softmax function in LaTeX, shown both inline within math mode and outside of it:

### Inline within Math Mode
The softmax function can be written inline within math mode as follows:

```latex
$\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{x_j}}$
```

This would render in a document as: $\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{x_j}}$.

### Inline Outside of Math Mode
To show the softmax function outside of math mode, you can use the following LaTeX code:

```latex
!\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{x_j}}!
```

This would be rendered in a document as: !\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{x_j}}!.

Please note that the `!` symbol is used here as a hypothetical delimiter to indicate non-math style inline LaTeX. In actual LaTeX documents, you might need to use a different method or package to achieve this effect.
