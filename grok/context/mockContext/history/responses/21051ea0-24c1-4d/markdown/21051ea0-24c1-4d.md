# 8th Grade Algebra Equations

In 8th grade algebra, students typically encounter a variety of equations that build on their understanding of basic algebraic concepts. Here are some examples of equations that an 8th grader might solve:

1. **Linear Equations**
   - Solving for \( x \) in a simple linear equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 15
     \]
     To solve, subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     2x = 12
     \]
     Then, divide by 2:
     \[
     x = 6
     \]

2. **Equations with Variables on Both Sides**
   - Solving for \( x \) when variables appear on both sides:
     \[
     3x + 4 = 2x + 9
     \]
     Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
     \[
     x + 4 = 9
     \]
     Then, subtract 4 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

3. **Equations Involving Fractions**
   - Solving for \( x \) in an equation with fractions:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 5
     \]
     Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}x = 2
     \]
     Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Quadratic Equations**
   - Solving a simple quadratic equation:
     \[
     x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
     \]
     Factor the quadratic equation:
     \[
     (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
     \]
     Set each factor equal to zero:
     \[
     x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0
     \]
     Solving these, we get:
     \[
     x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
     \]

5. **Systems of Equations**
   - Solving a system of linear equations:
     \[
     \begin{cases} 
     2x + y = 10 \\
     x - y = 1 
     \end{cases}
     \]
     Add the equations to eliminate \( y \):
     \[
     3x = 11
     \]
     Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{11}{3}
     \]
     Substitute \( x \) back into the second equation:
     \[
     \frac{11}{3} - y = 1
     \]
     Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{11}{3} - 1 = \frac{11}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
     \]
     So, the solution is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{11}{3}, \frac{8}{3} \right)
     \]

These examples cover a range of algebraic concepts that are typically introduced or reinforced in 8th grade, including solving linear equations, handling variables on both sides, working with fractions, solving quadratic equations, and solving systems of equations.
