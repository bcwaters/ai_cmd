Here are three fundamental equations used in signal processing:

### 1. Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. The equation for the continuous Fourier Transform is:

\[ X(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j2\pi ft} \, dt \]

where:
- \( X(f) \) is the Fourier Transform of the signal \( x(t) \)
- \( t \) is time
- \( f \) is frequency
- \( j \) is the imaginary unit

### 2. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

For digital signals, the Discrete Fourier Transform is used. The equation for the DFT is:

\[ X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn} \]

where:
- \( X(k) \) is the \( k \)-th element of the DFT of \( x(n) \)
- \( N \) is the number of samples
- \( n \) and \( k \) are integers ranging from 0 to \( N-1 \)

### 3. Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation used to express the output of a linear time-invariant system. The convolution of two functions \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \) is given by:

\[ (f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau \]

In the discrete case, it becomes:

\[ (f * g)[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} f[m] g[n-m] \]

These equations are essential for various signal processing applications, enabling the analysis and manipulation of signals in both time and frequency domains.
