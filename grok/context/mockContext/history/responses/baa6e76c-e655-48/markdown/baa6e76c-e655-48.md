Here are three models for AI image classification that can be run in TensorFlow.js:

1. **MobileNet**
   MobileNet is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for mobile and edge devices. It can be used for AI-generated image detection after fine-tuning. To use MobileNet in TensorFlow.js, you would load the model, preprocess the input images, and then use the model for prediction.

   ```javascript
   // Load the pretrained MobileNet model
   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/mobilenet/model.json');

   // Preprocess the image
   const imageTensor = preprocessImage(image);

   // Make a prediction
   const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);

   // Interpret the prediction
   const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();
   const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5;

   console.log('Is AI-generated:', isAI);
   ```

2. **ResNet**
   ResNet (Residual Network) models like ResNet50 or ResNet100 are popular for image classification tasks. They can be fine-tuned for detecting AI-generated images. In TensorFlow.js, you would follow a similar process as with MobileNet to load, preprocess, and predict.

   ```javascript
   // Load the pretrained ResNet model
   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/resnet/model.json');

   // Preprocess the image
   const imageTensor = preprocessImage(image);

   // Make a prediction
   const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);

   // Interpret the prediction
   const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();
   const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5;

   console.log('Is AI-generated:', isAI);
   ```

3. **EfficientNet**
   EfficientNet, developed by Google, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being efficient in terms of parameters and FLOPs. These models can be fine-tuned for AI-generated image detection. The process to use EfficientNet in TensorFlow.js is similar to the other models.

   ```javascript
   // Load the pretrained EfficientNet model
   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/efficientnet/model.json');

   // Preprocess the image
   const imageTensor = preprocessImage(image);

   // Make a prediction
   const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);

   // Interpret the prediction
   const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();
   const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5;

   console.log('Is AI-generated:', isAI);
   ```

These models can be loaded and used in TensorFlow.js to detect AI-generated images by following the example code provided above.
