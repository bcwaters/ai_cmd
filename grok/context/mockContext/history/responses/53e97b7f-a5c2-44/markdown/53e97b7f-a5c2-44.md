Here is an example of non-inline (display) math using Markdown with KaTeX integration:

```markdown
$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
```

This code will render the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in display math style, centered and on its own line.

And here is the same equation using plain LaTeX for display math:

```latex
\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
\]
```

Both of these will produce the same visual output when rendered, showing the equation:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
