# Setting Up NGINX as a Reverse Proxy to Docker Containers

To set up NGINX as a reverse proxy for Docker containers, follow these steps:

1. **Install NGINX**: Ensure NGINX is installed on your host machine. You can install it using your package manager, for example, on Ubuntu:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```

2. **Create a Docker Network**: It's beneficial to create a Docker network to facilitate communication between containers and the host.
   ```sh
   docker network create my-network
   ```

3. **Run Docker Containers**: Start your Docker containers and connect them to the network you created. For example, if you're running a Node.js application:
   ```sh
   docker run --name myapp -p 3000:3000 --network my-network myapp-image
   ```

4. **Configure NGINX**: Create a new configuration file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory. For example, create a file named `myapp.conf`:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://myapp:3000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Link the Configuration**: Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:
   ```sh
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

6. **Test and Restart NGINX**: Test the configuration for errors and restart NGINX:
   ```sh
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

7. **Verify the Setup**: Access your application through the NGINX server to ensure everything is working as expected.

This setup allows NGINX to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to your Docker container running the application.
