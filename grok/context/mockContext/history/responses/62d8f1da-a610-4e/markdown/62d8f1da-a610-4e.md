Here are five open source machine learning libraries that XAI might use, based on general practices in the AI research community:

1. **TensorFlow**
   - TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's widely used for building and deploying machine learning models, including deep learning models.

2. **PyTorch**
   - PyTorch is another widely-used open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It's known for its flexibility and ease of use, especially in research settings.

3. **scikit-learn**
   - scikit-learn is a machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, making it a go-to library for traditional machine learning tasks.

4. **Keras**
   - Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It can run on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano. Keras is designed for fast experimentation with deep neural networks.

5. **Hugging Face**
   - Hugging Face is known for its transformers library, which provides state-of-the-art machine learning models for natural language processing tasks. It's widely used in both research and industry.

Please note that while these libraries are commonly used in the AI community, there is no public confirmation that XAI specifically uses these libraries.
