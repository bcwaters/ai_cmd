# Choosing Between remarkMath and remarkKatex

When deciding whether to use `remarkMath` or `remarkKatex`, it's important to understand their roles and how they fit into your workflow for processing Markdown with embedded LaTeX expressions. Here's a breakdown to help you make an informed decision:

### remarkMath

- **Purpose:** `remarkMath` is a plugin for the `remark` processor, which is used to parse Markdown. Its primary function is to identify and extract mathematical expressions written in LaTeX syntax from Markdown text.
- **Usage:** It is typically used as part of a processing pipeline in tools like `unified`. `remarkMath` prepares the math expressions for further processing but does not render the math; it simply recognizes and isolates it within the Markdown text.
- **Integration:** It is often used in conjunction with other plugins to convert Markdown to other formats like HTML, where the math can then be rendered.
- **Example:** In the context of the steps provided, `remarkMath` would be used to detect and mark LaTeX expressions in the Markdown, preparing them for subsequent rendering by a tool like KaTeX.

### remarkKatex

- **Purpose:** `remarkKatex` is not directly mentioned in the context provided, but based on its name, it would likely integrate the functionality of KaTeX into the remark ecosystem. KaTeX is a fast JavaScript library for rendering mathematical expressions on the web.
- **Usage:** If `remarkKatex` exists, it would use KaTeX to render LaTeX expressions into visually appealing and correctly formatted mathematical symbols and equations. It would be the rendering engine that actually displays the math on a webpage.
- **Integration:** In a setup similar to the steps described, `remarkKatex` would apply KaTeX rendering to the HTML output after the Markdown has been converted to HTML.
- **Example:** In the provided code, a similar plugin like `rehype-katex` is used to process the LaTeX expressions identified by `remarkMath` and convert them into HTML that can be displayed in a browser.

### Conclusion

- **Use `remarkMath`** if you need to identify and prepare LaTeX expressions within Markdown for further processing. It is essential in the initial stage of parsing Markdown to ensure that LaTeX expressions are correctly identified and isolated.
- **Use `remarkKatex` (if it exists) or a similar plugin like `rehype-katex`** if you need to render those LaTeX expressions into HTML and CSS for display on the web. This would be the final step in the pipeline where the math is actually rendered and shown to the user.

Both tools are essential in a pipeline for processing Markdown with embedded LaTeX, where `remarkMath` prepares the math for rendering, and `remarkKatex` or a similar tool does the actual rendering.
