# Unified.js

Unified.js is a powerful JavaScript framework designed for processing and transforming content, particularly text. It's part of a broader ecosystem known as the "unified collective," which includes tools for working with markdown, HTML, and other text formats. Here's a brief overview:

- **Purpose**: Unified.js is primarily used for creating and manipulating abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of text content. This allows for easy transformation and processing of text, such as converting between formats, adding syntax highlighting, or performing other modifications.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Plugins**: Unified.js supports a wide range of plugins that can be used to extend its functionality. These plugins can handle tasks like parsing, transforming, and stringifying content.
  - **Pipelines**: You can create processing pipelines by chaining multiple plugins together, enabling complex transformations in a modular and maintainable way.
  - **Integration**: It integrates well with other tools in the unified ecosystem, such as remark (for markdown), rehype (for HTML), and retext (for natural language).

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Documentation**: Unified.js is often used in documentation systems to convert markdown to HTML or to apply custom transformations.
  - **Static Site Generators**: It's used in static site generators to process and transform content before it's rendered.
  - **Text Analysis**: It can be used for natural language processing tasks, such as syntax analysis or text transformation.

- **Example**:
  Here's a simple example of how you might use Unified.js to process a markdown file:

  ```javascript
  const unified = require('unified')
  const markdown = require('remark-parse')
  const remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
  const html = require('rehype-stringify')

  unified()
    .use(markdown)
    .use(remark2rehype)
    .use(html)
    .process('# Hello, world!', (err, file) => {
      console.log(String(file))
    })
  ```

  This example converts a markdown string to HTML using a pipeline of plugins.
