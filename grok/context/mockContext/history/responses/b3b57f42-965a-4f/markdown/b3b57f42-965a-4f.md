Here are examples of LaTeX in both code blocks and inline formats:

### Inline LaTeX

Inline LaTeX is used to embed mathematical expressions within text. Here are examples of the concepts discussed:

- **Big O Notation**: The time complexity of an algorithm can be represented as $O(n)$ for linear time, $O(n^2)$ for quadratic time, $O(\log n)$ for logarithmic time, and $O(n \log n)$ for linearithmic time.

- **Turing Machines**: The transition function of a Turing machine can be written as $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$, where $Q$ is the set of states, $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, and $L$ and $R$ represent left and right movement of the read/write head.

- **P vs NP Problem**: The P vs NP problem can be stated as $P \stackrel{?}{=} NP$, where $P$ is the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time and $NP$ is the set of decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.

- **Complexity Classes**: The complexity classes can be represented as $P = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k\}$, $NP = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a nondeterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k\}$, $PSPACE = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ uses space } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k\}$, and $EXPTIME = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(2^{n^k}) \text{ for some } k\}$.

### LaTeX Code Blocks

LaTeX code blocks are used for more complex expressions or when you want to display the LaTeX code itself. Here are the same concepts in LaTeX code blocks:

#### Big O Notation

```latex
\begin{align}
O(n) & \text{ represents linear time complexity} \\
O(n^2) & \text{ represents quadratic time complexity} \\
O(\log n) & \text{ represents logarithmic time complexity} \\
O(n \log n) & \text{ represents linearithmic time complexity}
\end{align}
```

#### Turing Machines

```latex
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}
```

#### P vs NP Problem

```latex
P \stackrel{?}{=} NP
```

#### Complexity Classes

```latex
\begin{align}
P & = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k\} \\
NP & = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a nondeterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k\} \\
PSPACE & = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ uses space } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k\} \\
EXPTIME & = \{L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(2^{n^k}) \text{ for some } k\}
\end{align}
```

These examples demonstrate how to use LaTeX both inline and in code blocks to represent theoretical computer science concepts.
