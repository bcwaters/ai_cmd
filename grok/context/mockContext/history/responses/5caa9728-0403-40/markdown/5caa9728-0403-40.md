# Uses of fcgiwrap

fcgiwrap is a simple server for running CGI applications over FastCGI. Here are its primary uses:

- **CGI Execution**: fcgiwrap allows traditional CGI scripts to be run in a FastCGI environment, which can improve performance and scalability compared to traditional CGI.

- **Compatibility**: It provides a bridge between modern web servers like NGINX that support FastCGI and older applications that are written as CGI scripts, ensuring compatibility without needing to rewrite the applications.

- **Integration with NGINX**: When used with NGINX, fcgiwrap can handle CGI requests efficiently, making it suitable for environments where NGINX is used as a reverse proxy or load balancer.

- **Security**: By running CGI scripts in a controlled FastCGI environment, fcgiwrap can help enforce security policies, such as running scripts with least privilege.

- **Performance**: Since FastCGI processes can be reused, fcgiwrap helps in reducing the overhead of starting a new process for each CGI request, thus enhancing server performance.

- **Maintenance**: It simplifies the management of CGI applications by centralizing their execution through FastCGI, which can ease maintenance and updates.
