# Warning: Using `eval` for Executing JavaScript Code

Using `eval` to execute JavaScript code, as shown in your snippet, can be highly risky due to security concerns. Here's a safer approach using Node.js's `child_process` module to execute the code in a separate process.

## Step 1: Modify `server.js`

Open `server.js` and replace the line where you execute the JavaScript code with the following code snippet:

```javascript
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

try {
    // Execute the JavaScript code using Node.js
    const result = execSync(`node -e "${code}"`, { encoding: 'utf-8' });

    // Write the result to a file
    const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt');
    fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, result);

    // Send the file back to the client
    res.download(outputPath, 'output.txt');
} catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(`Error executing code: ${error.message}`);
}
// The rest of the code remains the same
```

## Step 2: Test the Server

After making these changes, restart your server and test it using the same `curl` command as before:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/?code=const%20message%20=%20%22hello%20world!%22;%20console.log(message)'
```

This should download a file named `output.txt` with the content `hello world!`.

## Notes

- **Security**: While using `child_process.execSync` is safer than `eval`, it still allows running arbitrary code. Ensure this is used only in a controlled environment or for educational purposes.
- **Error Handling**: The server now catches errors from the Node.js execution and sends them back to the client.
- **File Management**: The handling of the output file remains the same, creating and then deleting it after sending.

This setup will allow you to send a GET request to the server with a `code` query parameter, execute that code using Node.js, write the result to a file, and then send that file back to the client.
