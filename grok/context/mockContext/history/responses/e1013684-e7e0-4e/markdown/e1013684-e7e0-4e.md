Here's an example of a simple LaTeX equation for you:

```latex
E = mc^2
```

This equation represents Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence. In LaTeX, `E` represents energy, `m` represents mass, and `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. The `^2` indicates that `c` is squared.

If you want to see this rendered, you would typically use a tool like KaTeX or MathJax after processing the Markdown with a plugin like `remark-math` to identify and isolate the LaTeX, followed by a rendering step with something like `rehype-katex`.
