Here are two basic math equations:

1. **Linear Equation:**
   \[
   y = mx + b
   \]
   This equation represents a straight line where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

2. **Quadratic Equation:**
   \[
   ax^2 + bx + c = 0
   \]
   This equation represents a parabola where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) is the variable.

Would you like to know more about these equations or are there other types of equations you're interested in?
