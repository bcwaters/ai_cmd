# Quadratic Equation: Detailed Explanation

## Definition
A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation of the form:
\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(a 
eq 0\). The term \(ax^2\) is the quadratic term, \(bx\) is the linear term, and \(c\) is the constant term.

## Characteristics
- **Parabola**: The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, which is a U-shaped curve. If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards, and if \(a < 0\), it opens downwards.
- **Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is the point where the curve reaches its minimum or maximum value. The vertex form of the quadratic equation is:
  \[
  y = a(x - h)^2 + k
  \]
  where \((h, k)\) is the vertex.
- **Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line passing through the vertex, given by \(x = h\).

## Solving Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods:

### 1. Factoring
If the quadratic can be factored into the form:
\[
(a x + d)(b x + e) = 0
\]
then the solutions are found by setting each factor to zero:
\[
x = -\frac{d}{a} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{e}{b}
\]

### 2. Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula provides the solutions for any quadratic equation:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, \(b^2 - 4ac\) is called the discriminant:
- If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions.
- If it is zero, there is exactly one real solution (a repeated root).
- If it is negative, there are two complex solutions.

### 3. Completing the Square
This method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial:
\[
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}
\]
\[
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2
\]
\[
\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}
\]
\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

## Applications
Quadratic equations are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. Examples include:
- **Projectile Motion**: Calculating the path of a projectile.
- **Optimization Problems**: Finding the maximum or minimum values in business and engineering.
- **Geometry**: Solving for areas and volumes of certain shapes.
