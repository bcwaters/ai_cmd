<h1>Quadratic Equation: Detailed Explanation</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation of the form:
[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
]
where (a), (b), and (c) are constants, and (a 
eq 0). The term (ax^2) is the quadratic term, (bx) is the linear term, and (c) is the constant term.</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parabola</strong>: The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, which is a U-shaped curve. If (a &gt; 0), the parabola opens upwards, and if (a &lt; 0), it opens downwards.</li>
<li><strong>Vertex</strong>: The vertex of the parabola is the point where the curve reaches its minimum or maximum value. The vertex form of the quadratic equation is:
[
y = a(x - h)^2 + k
]
where ((h, k)) is the vertex.</li>
<li><strong>Axis of Symmetry</strong>: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line passing through the vertex, given by (x = h).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations</h2>
<p>Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods:</p>
<h3>1. Factoring</h3>
<p>If the quadratic can be factored into the form:
[
(a x + d)(b x + e) = 0
]
then the solutions are found by setting each factor to zero:
[
x = -\frac{d}{a} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{e}{b}
]</p>
<h3>2. Quadratic Formula</h3>
<p>The quadratic formula provides the solutions for any quadratic equation:
[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
]
Here, (b^2 - 4ac) is called the discriminant:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions.</li>
<li>If it is zero, there is exactly one real solution (a repeated root).</li>
<li>If it is negative, there are two complex solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Completing the Square</h3>
<p>This method involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial:
[
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}
]
[
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2
]
[
\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}
]
[
x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
]</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Quadratic equations are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projectile Motion</strong>: Calculating the path of a projectile.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization Problems</strong>: Finding the maximum or minimum values in business and engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Geometry</strong>: Solving for areas and volumes of certain shapes.</li>
</ul>
