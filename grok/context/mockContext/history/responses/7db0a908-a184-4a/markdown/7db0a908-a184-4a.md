Here are two LaTeX options for representing "unified":

### Option 1: Using `\text` command

```latex
\text{unified}
```

This option uses the `\text` command to typeset the word "unified" in a roman (upright) font, which is commonly used within mathematical expressions or when you need to insert text in a math environment.

### Option 2: Using `\textit` command

```latex
\textit{unified}
```

This option uses the `\textit` command to typeset the word "unified" in an italic font, which can be used to emphasize the word or to match the style of surrounding text if needed.

Both options can be used depending on the context and the desired visual effect in your LaTeX document.
