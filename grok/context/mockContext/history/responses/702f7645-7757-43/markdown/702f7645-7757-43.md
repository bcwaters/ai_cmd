To set up NGINX to serve static HTML pages, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install NGINX

First, ensure that NGINX is installed on your server. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you would use:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

### Step 2: Configure NGINX

After installation, you need to configure NGINX to serve your static HTML files. The default configuration file is usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory.

1. **Create or edit a configuration file:**
   You can create a new configuration file or edit an existing one. For a new site, you might want to create a file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`, for example, `example.com`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
   ```

2. **Add the following configuration to serve static HTML:**

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com www.example.com;

       location / {
           root /var/www/example.com/html;
           index index.html index.htm;
       }
   }
   ```

   - `listen 80;` specifies that the server will listen on port 80.
   - `server_name` specifies the domain names for this server block.
   - `location /` specifies that requests to the root URL should be served from the specified directory.
   - `root` specifies the directory where your HTML files are stored.
   - `index` specifies the default file to serve if a directory is requested.

3. **Create the directory and place your HTML files:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
   sudo nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
   ```

   Add your HTML content to `index.html`.

4. **Enable the new site configuration:**

   If you created a new file in `sites-available`, you need to link it to `sites-enabled`:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

5. **Test the configuration and restart NGINX:**

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### Step 3: Verify

Open a web browser and navigate to your domain (`example.com`). You should see the content of your `index.html` file.

This setup should now allow NGINX to serve your static HTML pages efficiently.
