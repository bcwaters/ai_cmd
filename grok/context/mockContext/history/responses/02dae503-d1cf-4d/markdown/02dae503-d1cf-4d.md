### Softmax Equation

The softmax function is used in various machine learning models, particularly in classification tasks, to convert a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution.

#### Math LaTeX Syntax

In math LaTeX syntax, the softmax equation for a vector \( \mathbf{z} \) with \( K \) elements is given by:

$$
\text{softmax}(\mathbf{z})_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( K \), \( z_i \) is the \( i \)-th element of the input vector \( \mathbf{z} \), and \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

#### Plain LaTeX

In plain LaTeX, the same equation would be written as:

```
\text{softmax}(\mathbf{z})_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
```

This equation ensures that the output values are all positive and sum up to 1, forming a valid probability distribution.
