To create a TensorFlow.js application that detects AI-generated images, we'll need to use a pre-trained model for image classification, specifically tailored to differentiate between AI-generated and real images. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up such an application:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First, ensure you have Node.js installed, and then set up a new project:

```bash
mkdir ai-image-detector
cd ai-image-detector
npm init -y
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node
```

### Step 2: Load the Model
For this example, we'll assume you have a pre-trained model available. You can train your own or use an existing one. Here, we'll load a hypothetical model from a URL.

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');
const tfnode = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');

// Load the model
async function loadModel() {
    const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('https://your-model-url/model.json');
    return model;
}
```

### Step 3: Image Preprocessing
Before feeding the image to the model, we need to preprocess it. This typically involves resizing and normalizing the image.

```javascript
async function preprocessImage(imagePath) {
    // Load the image
    const imageBuffer = fs.readFileSync(imagePath);
    const tfimage = tfnode.node.decodeImage(imageBuffer, 3);
    
    // Resize the image to the model's expected input size
    const resized = tf.image.resizeBilinear(tfimage, [224, 224]);
    
    // Normalize the image
    const offset = tf.scalar(255);
    const normalized = resized.div(offset);
    
    // Expand the tensor to add a batch dimension
    const batched = normalized.expandDims(0);
    
    return batched;
}
```

### Step 4: Prediction Function
Now, we'll create a function to predict whether an image is AI-generated or not.

```javascript
async function predict(model, imageTensor) {
    const prediction = await model.predict(imageTensor);
    const probabilities = prediction.dataSync();
    const isAI = probabilities[0] > 0.5; // Assuming binary classification where 0 is real, 1 is AI-generated
    
    return isAI;
}
```

### Step 5: Main Function
Combine everything into a main function that processes an image and returns the result.

```javascript
async function main(imagePath) {
    const model = await loadModel();
    const imageTensor = await preprocessImage(imagePath);
    const result = await predict(model, imageTensor);
    
    console.log(`The image is ${result ? 'AI-generated' : 'real'}.`);
}

// Run the main function
main('path/to/your/image.jpg');
```

This code provides a basic framework for detecting AI-generated images using TensorFlow.js. Note that you will need to adjust the model URL, preprocessing steps, and prediction logic based on the specifics of your pre-trained model.
