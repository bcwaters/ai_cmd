# Prompt for Claude to Set Up Unit Test Mocks for All JS Files in Your Project

To set up unit test mocks for all JS files in your project using Jest, while keeping your business logic unchanged and storing the tests in a separate `tests` directory, you can provide the following prompt to Claude:

---

**Prompt for Claude:**

"Claude, please set up Jest unit test mocks for all JavaScript files in my project. The business logic in my existing files should remain unchanged. I want the tests to be organized in a separate directory named `tests`. Here's what I need:

1. **Install Jest**: First, ensure that Jest is installed in my project. If it's not already installed, please add it to my `package.json` as a dev dependency.

2. **Create Test Directory**: Create a new directory named `tests` at the root level of my project.

3. **Generate Test Files**: For each JavaScript file in my project (excluding files already in the `tests` directory), create a corresponding test file in the `tests` directory. The test file should have the same name as the original file but with `.test.js` appended to the end.

4. **Set Up Mocks**: In each test file, set up mocks for any external dependencies or modules that are imported in the corresponding original file. Use Jest's `jest.mock()` function to create these mocks.

5. **Write Basic Test Structure**: Include a basic test structure in each test file that tests the main functionality of the corresponding original file. The tests should not alter the business logic but should verify its correctness.

6. **Update `package.json`**: Ensure that the `package.json` file is updated to include a test script that runs Jest.

Here's an example of how the directory structure and a test file might look:

```plaintext
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── utils.js
│   └── otherModule.js
├── tests/
│   ├── utils.test.js
│   └── otherModule.test.js
└── package.json
```

For `utils.js` which might contain:

```javascript
// utils.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = { add };
```

The corresponding test file `utils.test.js` should look like this:

```javascript
// tests/utils.test.js
const { add } = require('../src/utils');

jest.mock('../src/otherModule', () => ({
  // Mock any dependencies here
}));

describe('utils', () => {
  test('add function should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

Please ensure that all these steps are followed accurately to set up the unit testing environment for my project."

This prompt should guide Claude to set up Jest, create the necessary test files, and ensure that mocks are properly implemented without altering the existing business logic. The tests will be neatly organized in a `tests` directory, keeping your project structure clean and maintainable.
