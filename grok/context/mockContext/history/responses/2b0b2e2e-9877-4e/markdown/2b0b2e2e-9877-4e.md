To invoke your `writeHtml.js` file when someone uses your Express GET endpoint, you should import the JavaScript file into your Express server file. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Import the `writeHtml.js` file:**
   In your Express server file (e.g., `server.js`), you can import the `writeHtml.js` file using `require`.

   ```javascript
   const writeHtml = require('./writeHtml');
   ```

2. **Set up the Express GET endpoint:**
   Use the imported function within your Express route handler.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   // Import writeHtml.js
   const writeHtml = require('./writeHtml');

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       // Call the function from writeHtml.js
       writeHtml();
       
       // Send a response to the client
       res.send('HTML file has been written.');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

In this setup, when a GET request is made to the root path (`'/'`), the `writeHtml` function will be executed, and a response will be sent back to the client.

**Note:** Ensure that `writeHtml.js` exports the function you want to use. For example, in `writeHtml.js`, you should have something like:

```javascript
function writeHtml() {
    // Your code to write HTML to a file
}

module.exports = writeHtml;
```

You should not use an EXE command to run the JavaScript file from within your Express server. Instead, importing and calling the function directly within your Express route handler is the appropriate approach.
