To install `remark-highlight.js`, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install remark-highlight.js
```

This will add the `remark-highlight.js` package to your project, allowing you to use syntax highlighting for code blocks when processing Markdown with remark.

Remember to integrate this package into your unified pipeline as shown in the previous setup example to enable syntax highlighting.
