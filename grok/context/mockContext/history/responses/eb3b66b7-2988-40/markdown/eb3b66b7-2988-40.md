In the realm of computational theory, concepts like $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time complexity, Turing machine transitions $\delta(q, a) = (q', a', d)$, the undecidable nature of the halting problem $\text{Halt}(P, I)$, and regular expressions like $(a^*b^*a^*)^*b^*$ for languages with specific patterns are frequently discussed. Linear equations such as $2x + 3 = 7$, quadratic equations $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, derivatives $\frac{d}{dx}x^2 = 2x$, integrals $\int x \, dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C$, systems of equations $\begin{cases} x + y = 5 \\ 2x - y = 1 \end{cases}$, matrices $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$, and limits $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$ also play crucial roles in understanding and solving computational problems.
