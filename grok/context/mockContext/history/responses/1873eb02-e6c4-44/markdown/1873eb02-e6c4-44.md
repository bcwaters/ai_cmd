Here are two equations presented in markdown format:

### Equation 1: Linear Equation in Standard Form
\[ Ax + By = C \]

This is a general form of a linear equation where:
- \( A \) and \( B \) are coefficients of \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.
- \( C \) is a constant term.

### Equation 2: Slope-Intercept Form
\[ y = mx + b \]

This form of a linear equation directly shows:
- \( m \) as the slope of the line.
- \( b \) as the y-intercept, where the line crosses the y-axis.
