Here are some LaTeX equations illustrating key concepts from our previous discussion on linear algebra in neural networks:

### Matrix Multiplication in Neural Networks

In neural networks, the transformation of input data through layers can be represented using matrix multiplication. If $\mathbf{x}$ is the input vector and $\mathbf{W}$ is the weight matrix of a layer, the output $\mathbf{y}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W} \cdot \mathbf{x}
$$

This operation is central to how neural networks process and transform data.

### Backpropagation and Gradient Calculation

Backpropagation involves calculating the gradient of the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the weights $\mathbf{W}$. This can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{W}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{y}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{W}}
$$

where $\mathbf{y}$ is the output of the layer. This gradient is used to update the weights during training.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in PCA

In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the covariance matrix $\mathbf{A}$ of the data is decomposed into its eigenvectors $\mathbf{V}$ and eigenvalues $\lambda$:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{V} \Lambda \mathbf{V}^{-1}
$$

The eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues represent the directions of maximum variance in the data.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD decomposes a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ into three matrices:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \Sigma \mathbf{V}^T
$$

where $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are orthogonal matrices, and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values. This decomposition is useful for data compression and noise reduction.

### Linear Transformations in Convolutional Neural Networks

In CNNs, the convolution operation can be seen as a linear transformation. If $\text{input}$ is the input data and $\text{kernel}$ is the filter, the convolution can be written as:

$$
\text{output}_{ij} = \sum_m \sum_n \text{input}_{i+m, j+n} \cdot \text{kernel}_{m,n}
$$

This operation, combined with nonlinear activation functions, allows CNNs to learn hierarchical features from the data.

These LaTeX equations highlight the role of linear algebra in the functioning and training of neural networks.
