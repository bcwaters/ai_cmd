# LaTeX Examples: Softmax, Trigonometry, and Order Notation

In this section, we'll explore LaTeX representations of the softmax function, trigonometric identities, and order notation commonly used in mathematics and computer science.

## Softmax Function

The softmax function is a crucial component in machine learning, particularly in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification. Here's how it's represented in LaTeX:

```latex
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^k e^{z_j}}
```

In this equation:
- $z_i$ represents the input to the output layer for the $i$-th class.
- $k$ is the total number of classes.
- The denominator is the sum of the exponentials of all inputs.

## Trigonometric Identities

Trigonometry is fundamental in mathematics and physics. Let's look at some common trigonometric identities in LaTeX:

```latex
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
```

This is the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions.

```latex
\sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b)
```

This is the angle addition formula for sine.

```latex
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
```

This defines the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine.

## Order Notation

Order notation, particularly Big O notation, is crucial in algorithm analysis and computer science. Here are some examples in LaTeX:

```latex
O(n) \quad \text{(linear time complexity)}
```

```latex
O(n^2) \quad \text{(quadratic time complexity)}
```

```latex
O(\log n) \quad \text{(logarithmic time complexity)}
```

```latex
O(n \log n) \quad \text{(linearithmic time complexity)}
```

These notations describe the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or space requirements relative to the input size $n$.

## Combining Concepts

Let's combine these concepts in a more complex example:

```latex
\text{Let } f(n) = O(n^2) \text{ be the time complexity of an algorithm that uses softmax activation.}
\text{The softmax function for the output layer is given by:}
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^k e^{z_j}}
\text{If we apply this to a trigonometric function, we get:}
\text{softmax}(\sin(\theta)) = \frac{e^{\sin(\theta)}}{\sum_{j=1}^k e^{\sin(\theta_j)}}
```

This example demonstrates how LaTeX can be used to combine concepts from machine learning, trigonometry, and algorithm analysis in a clear and concise manner.

These LaTeX examples showcase the power of mathematical notation in representing complex concepts from various fields of study. By using LaTeX, we can create precise and visually appealing representations of mathematical ideas, making them easier to understand and communicate.
