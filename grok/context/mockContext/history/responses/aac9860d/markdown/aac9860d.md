# Boolean Addition in JavaScript

In JavaScript, when you perform addition operations with boolean values, they are implicitly converted to numbers. The conversion rules are as follows:

- `false` is converted to `0`.
- `true` is converted to `1`.

Therefore, if you add two boolean values together, the result will be based on these numeric conversions. Let's see an example:

```javascript
let result = true + true;
console.log(result); // Output: 2
```

In this case, `true + true` is equivalent to `1 + 1`, which results in `2`.

So, to answer your question directly: **Yes, in JavaScript, `true + true` equals `2`.**
