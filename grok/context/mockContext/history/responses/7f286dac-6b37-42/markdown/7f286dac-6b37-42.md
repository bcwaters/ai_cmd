# Applications of TensorFlow.js by Big Tech in the Browser

## Google's Teachable Machine

Google's Teachable Machine is an interactive web-based tool that uses TensorFlow.js to enable users to create machine learning models directly in their browser. It allows users to train a model to recognize images, sounds, or poses without writing any code. This application demonstrates the power of TensorFlow.js by making machine learning accessible to a broader audience, showcasing real-time model training and inference in the browser.

```javascript
// Example of using TensorFlow.js in Teachable Machine
const model = await tmImage.loadFromFiles(video, {
  tmFile: 'model.tm',
  metadataFile: 'metadata.json',
  weightsFile: 'weights.bin'
});

const prediction = await model.predict(video);
console.log(prediction);
```

## Microsoft's Azure Custom Vision

Microsoft leverages TensorFlow.js in its Azure Custom Vision service to provide a browser-based interface for training and deploying image classification models. Users can upload images, train a model, and then use the trained model directly in the browser for real-time predictions. This application highlights the scalability and ease of use of TensorFlow.js for enterprise-level machine learning tasks.

```javascript
// Example of using TensorFlow.js in Azure Custom Vision
const model = await cocoSsd.load();
const predictions = await model.detect(document.getElementById('img'));

predictions.forEach(prediction => {
  console.log(prediction);
});
```
