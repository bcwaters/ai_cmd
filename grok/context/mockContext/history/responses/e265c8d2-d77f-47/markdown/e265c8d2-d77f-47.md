### Number Theory
The sum of numbers divisible by 3 can be expressed as:

sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = 3 \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i + 3t

where \(a_i = 3k_i\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i\) is an integer.

### Algebra
#### Quadratic Equation
The general form of a quadratic equation is:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

The solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:

x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

### Pythagorean Theorem
For a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\) and hypotenuse \(c\), the relationship between the sides is:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

### Calculus
#### Derivative
The derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is denoted as \(f'(x)\) and represents the rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\). For example, the derivative of \(f(x) = x^2\) is:

f'(x) = 2x

#### Integral
The integral of a function \(f(x)\) represents the area under the curve of \(f(x)\). The indefinite integral of \(f(x) = x^2\) is:

\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C

where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

### Physics
#### Einstein's Equation
Einstein's famous equation relating mass and energy is:

E = mc^2

where \(E\) is energy, \(m\) is mass, and \(c\) is the speed of light.

#### Newton's Second Law
Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:

F = ma

where \(F\) is force, \(m\) is mass, and \(a\) is acceleration.
