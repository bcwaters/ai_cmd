# Lesson Plan: Geometry Proofs

## Subject 1: Triangle Congruence Proofs

### Objective
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to prove triangle congruence using the following theorems: Side-Side-Side (SSS), Side-Angle-Side (SAS), and Angle-Side-Angle (ASA).

### Duration
45 minutes

### Materials
- Whiteboard and markers
- Geometry textbooks
- Worksheets with proof problems

### Lesson Plan

#### Introduction (10 minutes)
1. **Warm-Up Activity**: Students will be given a quick review of the basic properties of triangles and the concept of congruence.
2. **Introduction to Congruence Theorems**: The teacher introduces the SSS, SAS, and ASA theorems, explaining the conditions under which triangles are congruent.

#### Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
1. **Understanding Congruence Theorems**: The teacher explains each theorem in detail, using diagrams on the whiteboard to illustrate how the theorems work.
2. **Example Proofs**: The teacher demonstrates how to write proofs using each of the theorems. For instance:
   - **SSS Example**: Given $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ with $AB = DE$, $BC = EF$, and $CA = FD$, prove $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.
   - **SAS Example**: Given $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ with $AB = DE$, $\angle B = \angle E$, and $BC = EF$, prove $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.
   - **ASA Example**: Given $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ with $\angle A = \angle D$, $AB = DE$, and $\angle B = \angle E$, prove $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.

#### Guided Practice (10 minutes)
1. **Worksheet Activity**: Students work on worksheets with proof problems, applying the SSS, SAS, and ASA theorems to prove triangle congruence.
2. **Group Work**: Students are encouraged to work in pairs to discuss and solve the problems, allowing them to learn from each other.

#### Independent Practice (5 minutes)
1. **Individual Work**: Students are given a few more problems to solve on their own, reinforcing their understanding of the theorems.
2. **Review**: The teacher quickly reviews the answers to ensure understanding and address any misconceptions.

#### Closure (5 minutes)
1. **Summary**: The teacher recaps the key points of the lesson, emphasizing the importance of understanding and applying the SSS, SAS, and ASA theorems.
2. **Exit Ticket**: Students write down one thing they learned about triangle congruence and one question they still have.

### Assessment
- **Formative Assessment**: The teacher monitors student participation and understanding during the guided and independent practice.
- **Summative Assessment**: Exit tickets are used to gauge student learning and identify areas needing further clarification.
