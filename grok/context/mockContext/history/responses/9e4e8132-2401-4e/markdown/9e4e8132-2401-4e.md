# Troubleshooting NGINX Configuration Error

The error log indicates that NGINX failed to start due to a configuration issue. Specifically, the error message points to an unknown directive `js_path` in the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file at line 36.

### Error Details:
- **Error Log**: `nginx: [emerg] unknown directive "js_path" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:36`
- **Systemd Status**: `Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Tue 2025-03-04 09:54:25 PST; 21ms ago`

### What Happened:

1. **NGINX Configuration Test Failed**: The `ExecStartPre` command `/usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g daemon on; master_process on;` failed with an exit status of 1, indicating a configuration error.
2. **Unknown Directive**: The `js_path` directive is not recognized by NGINX, suggesting that the module required for this directive (`ngx_http_js_module`) is not loaded or installed properly.
3. **Package Installation Issue**: The `nginx-extras` package encountered an error during configuration, which might be related to the missing module.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Verify Module Installation**: Ensure that the `libnginx-mod-http-js` package, which provides the `ngx_http_js_module`, is installed. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libnginx-mod-http-js
   ```
2. **Check NGINX Configuration**: Open the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file and review the configuration. Ensure that the `js_path` directive is used only if the `ngx_http_js_module` is loaded. You might need to add the following line at the beginning of your `nginx.conf` file:
   ```nginx
   load_module modules/ngx_http_js_module.so;
   ```
3. **Test Configuration**: After making changes, test the NGINX configuration again with:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
4. **Restart NGINX**: If the test passes, restart NGINX to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### Additional Notes:

- **Package Management**: If you encounter issues with `nginx-extras`, consider purging and reinstalling it along with the `libnginx-mod-http-js` module.
- **Manual Compilation**: If package installation fails, you might need to compile NGINX from source with the `ngx_http_js_module` enabled.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the configuration error and successfully start NGINX.
