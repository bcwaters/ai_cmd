# Applying a Mask with TensorFlow.js

In this example, we will demonstrate how to apply a mask to an image using TensorFlow.js. This is a common operation in image processing and computer vision, where a mask can be used to selectively modify parts of an image.

Here's a step-by-step guide to apply a mask to an image using TensorFlow.js:

1. **Setup**: First, you need to include TensorFlow.js in your project. You can do this by adding the following script tag to your HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest"></script>
    ```

2. **Load Image**: Load the image you want to process. For simplicity, we'll assume you have a canvas element where the image is already drawn.

3. **Create Mask**: Create a mask tensor. This can be a binary mask (0s and 1s) where 1 indicates the area to be modified.

4. **Apply Mask**: Multiply the image tensor with the mask tensor to apply the mask.

Here is a JavaScript code snippet to perform this operation:

```javascript
// Assuming 'imageTensor' is a 3D tensor representing the image
// and 'maskTensor' is a 2D tensor representing the mask

// Convert image tensor to float if necessary
const floatImageTensor = tf.cast(imageTensor, 'float32');

// Expand the mask to match the image's dimensions
const expandedMask = maskTensor.expandDims(2).tile([1, 1, 3]);

// Apply the mask
const maskedImage = floatImageTensor.mul(expandedMask);

// Optionally, you can add another tensor to the masked areas
const additionalTensor = tf.zerosLike(floatImageTensor);
const result = maskedImage.add(additionalTensor.mul(expandedMask.logicalNot()));

// Convert back to uint8 if necessary
const uint8Result = tf.cast(result, 'int32');

// Display or further process the result
uint8Result.data().then(data => {
    // Handle the data as needed, e.g., draw to a canvas
});
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to apply a mask to an image using TensorFlow.js, allowing you to selectively modify parts of the image based on the mask provided.
