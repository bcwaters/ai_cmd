Here are some examples of LaTeX code for various mathematical concepts:

### Softmax Function
The softmax function can be represented in LaTeX as:
```latex
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{x_j}}
```
where \( x_i \) represents the \( i \)-th element of the input vector.

### Summation
A simple summation can be written in LaTeX as:
```latex
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
```

### Trigonometric Functions
The Pythagorean identity can be represented as:
```latex
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
```

### Big O Notation
Big O notation for an algorithm's time complexity can be written as:
```latex
O(n \log n)
```

### Sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function can be represented in LaTeX as:
```latex
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
```

### Batch Normalization
The formula for batch normalization can be written as:
```latex
\hat{x} = \frac{x - \text{E}[x]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x] + \epsilon}}
```

### Gradient Descent
The update rule for gradient descent can be represented as:
```latex
\theta = \theta - \alpha 
abla_{\theta} J(\theta)
```

### Jacobian Matrix
The Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function can be written as:
```latex
\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix}
```

These examples showcase various mathematical and algorithmic concepts using LaTeX notation, which is widely used in fields like machine learning, theoretical computer science, and mathematics.
