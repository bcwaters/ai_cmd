## Lesson Outline

### Introduction (15 minutes)
- **Brief Overview of Number Theory**: Explain that number theory is the branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of integers and integer-valued functions.
- **Relevance to Cryptography**: Introduce the concept of cryptography, emphasizing how number theory is crucial for modern encryption methods.

### Key Concepts in Number Theory (60 minutes)

#### 1. Euler's Totient Function (15 minutes)
- **Definition**: Explain that Euler's Totient Function, $\varphi(n)$, counts the positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  \varphi(n) = n \prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)
  \]
  where the product is over all distinct prime numbers $p$ dividing $n$.
- **Example**: Calculate $\varphi(12)$.

#### 2. Fermat's Little Theorem (15 minutes)
- **Statement**: If $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, we have:
  \[
  a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
  \]
- **Application in Cryptography**: Discuss how this theorem is used in the RSA algorithm.
- **Example**: Verify Fermat's Little Theorem for $a = 2$ and $p = 7$.

#### 3. Chinese Remainder Theorem (15 minutes)
- **Statement**: If one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer $n$ by several pairwise coprime integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of $n$ by the product of these integers.
- **Formula**: Given $n \equiv a_1 \pmod{m_1}$ and $n \equiv a_2 \pmod{m_2}$, there exists a unique solution modulo $m_1m_2$:
  \[
  n \equiv x \pmod{m_1m_2}
  \]
  where $x = a_1m_2y_2 + a_2m_1y_1$, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to $m_1y_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{m_2}$ and $m_2y_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{m_1}$.
- **Example**: Solve the system $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ and $x \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$.

#### 4. Sum of Divisors Function (15 minutes)
- **Definition**: The sum of the divisors of a number $n$, denoted as $\sigma(n)$, is given by:
  \[
  \sigma(n) = \sum_{d|n} d
  \]
- **Example**: Calculate $\sigma(6)$.

### Application in Cryptography (60 minutes)

#### RSA Encryption (30 minutes)
- **Overview**: Introduce the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
- **Key Generation**: Explain the process of generating public and private keys using Euler's Totient Function.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt a message using the RSA algorithm.
- **Example**: Encrypt and decrypt a simple message.

#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (30 minutes)
- **Overview**: Introduce the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
- **Process**: Explain the steps involved in the key exchange using modular arithmetic.
- **Example**: Walk through a simple example of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

### Conclusion and Q&A (15 minutes)
- **Recap**: Summarize the key points covered in the lesson.
- **Q&A**: Allow time for students to ask questions and clarify any doubts.
