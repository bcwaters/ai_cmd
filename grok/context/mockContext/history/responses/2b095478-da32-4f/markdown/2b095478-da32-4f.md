# Can NGINX Execute a Shell Script?

Yes, NGINX can execute shell scripts, but it does not do so directly. You can use certain modules or external programs to achieve this functionality. Here are a couple of ways to do it:

1. **Using ngx_http_perl_module:**
   The `ngx_http_perl_module` allows you to embed Perl scripts within NGINX configuration. You can use Perl to call shell scripts.

   ```nginx
   http {
       perl_modules perl/lib;
       perl_require exec_shell_script.pm;

       server {
           listen 80;
           location /run_script {
               perl exec_shell_script::run_script;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   And your `exec_shell_script.pm` might look like:

   ```perl
   package exec_shell_script;

   use NGINX;

   sub run_script {
       my $r = shift;
       system("/path/to/your/shell/script.sh");
       $r->send_http_header("text/plain");
       $r->print("Script executed");
       return NGINX_OK;
   }

   1;
   ```

2. **Using ngx_http_lua_module:**
   Similarly, you can use the Lua module to execute shell scripts.

   ```nginx
   http {
       lua_shared_dict shell_exec 10m;

       server {
           listen 80;
           location /run_script {
               content_by_lua_block {
                   local handle = io.popen("/path/to/your/shell/script.sh")
                   local result = handle:read("*a")
                   handle:close()
                   ngx.say(result)
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Using External Programs with fcgiwrap:**
   Another method is to use `fcgiwrap` to run CGI scripts, which can in turn execute shell scripts.

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       location /run_script {
           gzip off;
           include fastcgi_params;
           fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /path/to/your/shell/script.sh;
           fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $uri;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
       }
   }
   ```

**Important Note:** When executing shell scripts, always ensure you follow the principle of least privilege. Make sure the scripts are secure and cannot be exploited to execute arbitrary commands.
