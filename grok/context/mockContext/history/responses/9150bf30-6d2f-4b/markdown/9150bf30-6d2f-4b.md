Here are two examples of linear equations in different forms:

### Equation 1: Standard Form
The standard form of a linear equation is given by:
\[ Ax + By = C \]
An example of this is:
\[ 2x + 3y = 6 \]

### Equation 2: Slope-Intercept Form
The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is given by:
\[ y = mx + b \]
An example of this is:
\[ y = 2x + 1 \]

These examples illustrate different ways to express linear equations, which are useful in various mathematical and real-world applications.
