# TensorFlow.js Image Classification Setup

To set up image classification with TensorFlow.js, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install TensorFlow.js**: First, ensure you have TensorFlow.js installed in your project. You can do this by including the script in your HTML file or by using npm/yarn if you're using a module bundler.

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest"></script>
   ```

2. **Load a Pre-trained Model**: You can use a pre-trained model like MobileNet for image classification. Load it using the following code:

   ```javascript
   const mobilenet = await tf.loadLayersModel('https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_0.25_224/model.json');
   ```

3. **Prepare the Image**: Convert the image to a tensor that the model can process. This typically involves resizing the image and normalizing its pixel values.

   ```javascript
   const image = document.getElementById('myImage');
   const tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(image)
     .resizeNearestNeighbor([224, 224])
     .toFloat()
     .expandDims();
   const normalizedTensor = tensor.div(255);
   ```

4. **Make Predictions**: Use the model to make predictions on the prepared image.

   ```javascript
   const predictions = await mobilenet.predict(normalizedTensor);
   const topK = 5;
   const values = await predictions.data();
   const indices = Array.from(values)
     .map((value, index) => ({value, index}))
     .sort((a, b) => b.value - a.value)
     .slice(0, topK);

   indices.forEach((prediction) => {
     console.log(`Class: ${prediction.index}, Probability: ${prediction.value}`);
   });
   ```

5. **Display Results**: You can display these predictions on your web page, perhaps by updating the DOM with the top predictions and their probabilities.

   ```javascript
   const resultsDiv = document.getElementById('results');
   resultsDiv.innerHTML = indices.map(prediction => 
     `<p>Class: ${prediction.index}, Probability: ${prediction.value}</p>`
   ).join('');
   ```

This setup provides a basic framework for image classification using TensorFlow.js. You can further customize this by training your own model or integrating with other TensorFlow.js functionalities.
