# Jupiter

Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest planet in our solar system. Known as a gas giant, it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet's most prominent feature is its Great Red Spot, a storm that has been raging for at least 300 years. Jupiter also has a faint ring system and a strong magnetic field, which is the strongest of any planet in the solar system.

Jupiter's atmosphere is divided into several bands of different latitudes, known as zones and belts, which are characterized by differences in temperature and composition. These bands create the planet's colorful appearance. The planet also has dozens of moons, with the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—known as the Galilean moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.

The Great Red Spot, mentioned earlier, is a high-pressure region whose clouds are much taller and colder than the surrounding areas. This storm is so large that it could engulf three Earths. Observations of Jupiter have been made by various spacecraft, including the Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, and Juno missions, which have provided detailed data about the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, and moons.
