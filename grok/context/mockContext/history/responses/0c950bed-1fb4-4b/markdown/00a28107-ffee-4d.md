# Jupiter: A Detailed Overview

## Overview
Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system, is a gas giant with a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers). It is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm larger than the Earth that has been ongoing for at least 300 years.

## Atmosphere
Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun. The colorful bands seen in its atmosphere are due to cloud patterns and storm systems that are influenced by the planet's rapid rotationâ€”once every 9.9 hours.

### Composition:
- **Hydrogen**: About 89.8%
- **Helium**: About 10.2%
- **Trace gases**: Methane, ammonia, water vapor, and other compounds.

### Notable Features:
- **Great Red Spot**: A massive storm that has persisted for centuries.
- **Cloud Bands**: Alternating light and dark belts that encircle the planet.

## Moons
Jupiter has a total of 79 known moons, with the four largest known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

### Galilean Moons:
- **Io**: Known for its volcanic activity, the most geologically active body in the solar system.
- **Europa**: Believed to have an ocean beneath its icy surface, a potential site for extraterrestrial life.
- **Ganymede**: The largest moon in the solar system, even larger than the planet Mercury.
- **Callisto**: Heavily cratered and believed to have a subsurface ocean.

## Magnetic Field
Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, which is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field traps charged particles and creates intense radiation belts around the planet.

## Rings
Jupiter has a faint ring system, discovered by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1979. The rings are composed of dust particles ejected from its moons by meteoroid impacts.

## Exploration
Several spacecraft have visited Jupiter, including:
- **Pioneer 10 and 11**: First flybys in the 1970s.
- **Voyager 1 and 2**: Provided detailed images and data in the late 1970s.
- **Galileo**: Orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, studying the planet and its moons.
- **Juno**: Currently orbiting Jupiter since 2016, focusing on its atmosphere and magnetic field.

## Future Missions
- **Europa Clipper**: Planned by NASA to study Europa's potential for life.
- **JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer)**: A European Space Agency mission to study Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto.
