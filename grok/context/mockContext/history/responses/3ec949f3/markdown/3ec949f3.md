# Updating Your GitHub Repository URL

To update the URL of your GitHub repository, you'll need to change the remote URL that your local repository points to. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Check Current Remote URL

First, verify the current remote URL of your repository using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This command will list all the remote repositories configured for your local repository, showing both fetch and push URLs.

### Step 2: Update the Remote URL

To update the URL, you can use the `git remote set-url` command. There are two common scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Changing from HTTPS to SSH or vice versa

If you are switching between HTTPS and SSH, you can use:

```bash
git remote set-url origin <new-url>
```

Replace `<new-url>` with your new repository URL. For example:

- For HTTPS: `https://github.com/username/repository.git`
- For SSH: `git@github.com:username/repository.git`

#### Scenario 2: Renaming the Repository or Changing the Account

If you are renaming the repository or moving it to a different account, you'll need to update both the fetch and push URLs:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:newusername/newrepository.git
```

### Step 3: Verify the Change

After updating the URL, verify the change using:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This should now show the new URL for both fetch and push operations.

### Additional Notes

- **HTTPS vs. SSH**: If you switch from HTTPS to SSH, make sure you have an SSH key set up with GitHub.
- **Multiple Remotes**: If your repository has multiple remotes, ensure you update the correct one (commonly `origin`).

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully update your GitHub repository URL.
