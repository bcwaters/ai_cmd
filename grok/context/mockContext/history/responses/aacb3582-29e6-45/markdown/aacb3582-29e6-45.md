# Testing Confirmation

You are testing the system's response format and understanding of instructions. The system has confirmed understanding with a simple "yes" in the previous interaction.

Here is a brief example of how you might use the `grep` command with some of the flags and options we've discussed:

```bash
# Search for the word "example" in all files recursively, case-insensitively, and show line numbers
grep -rni "example" *
```

This command will search through all files in the current directory and its subdirectories for the word "example", ignoring case and displaying the line numbers where matches are found.

If you need to perform sequential commands, you can chain them using `&&` for successful execution dependency:

```bash
# First command && Second command
grep -rni "example" * && echo "Search completed successfully"
```

This will execute the echo command only if the grep command completes successfully.

Is there anything specific you'd like to test or any additional functionalities you want to explore with the `grep` command or other bash commands?
