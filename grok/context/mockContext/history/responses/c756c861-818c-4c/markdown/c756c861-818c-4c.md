To double the video speed using FFmpeg, you can use the `setpts` filter for the video and the `atempo` filter for the audio. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS" -filter:a "atempo=2.0" output.mp4
```

Let's break down the command:

- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input file.
- `-filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS"`: This filter doubles the speed of the video by halving the presentation timestamp (PTS).
- `-filter:a "atempo=2.0"`: This filter doubles the speed of the audio.
- `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file name.

Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system before running this command. This method will keep the video and audio in sync while speeding up the playback.
