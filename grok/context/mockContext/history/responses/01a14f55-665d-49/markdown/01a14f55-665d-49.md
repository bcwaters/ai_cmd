# Overview of the Flood Fill Oval Interior Script Project

This project implements a Python script using the Pillow library to perform a specialized flood fill operation on images. The primary function of this script is to fill the interior of oval shapes within an image while respecting transparent areas. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and usage:

## Functionality

- **Flood Fill Operation**: The script uses a flood fill algorithm to detect and fill the interior of oval shapes. It starts by identifying a suitable starting point for the fill operation and then expands to fill the entire interior of the oval, ensuring it does not cross into transparent areas.

- **Handling of Transparent Areas**: The script is designed to differentiate between the solid interior of an oval and any transparent regions within the image. This is crucial for accurately filling only the intended areas.

- **Command-Line Interface**: The script accepts command-line arguments for the input and output image paths, making it easy to automate and integrate into batch processing workflows.

- **Bash Script Integration**: A companion Bash script (`fill.sh`) is included to process all images within a specified directory, applying the Python script to each image and saving the results with a `_filled` suffix.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Use `uv` to create and activate a Python virtual environment, and install the Pillow library.
   
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # On Unix or MacOS
   .venv\\Scripts\\activate # On Windows
   uv pip install Pillow
   ```

2. **Running the Script**: Execute the Python script with the input and output image paths.

   ```bash
   python flood_fill.py unfilled.png out.png
   ```

3. **Batch Processing**: Use the Bash script to process all images in a directory.

   ```bash
   ./fill.sh <directory_path>
   ```

## Purpose

The project is particularly useful for tasks requiring the automatic filling of specific shapes in images, such as graphic design, image editing, and automated image processing workflows. By ensuring the fill respects transparency, it can be used in scenarios where maintaining the integrity of the original image's design is important.
