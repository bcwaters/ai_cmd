# Setting Up Symlinks for Python on macOS

To unify your Python experience across multiple versions on macOS, you can use symlinks. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

## Step 1: Install Python Versions
First, ensure you have multiple Python versions installed. You can use Homebrew to install different versions of Python:

```bash
brew install python@3.9
brew install python@3.10
```

## Step 2: Choose Your Preferred Python Version
Decide which version you want to be your default. For this example, let's assume you want Python 3.10 to be the default.

## Step 3: Locate Python Installations
Find the paths to your Python installations:

```bash
which python3.9
which python3.10
```

This will output something like `/usr/local/bin/python3.9` and `/usr/local/bin/python3.10`.

## Step 4: Create Symlinks
Navigate to the directory where your Python executables are located (usually `/usr/local/bin/`). Create a symlink for `python` and `python3` pointing to your preferred version:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s python3.10 python3
ln -s python3.10 python
```

## Step 5: Verify the Symlinks
Check if the symlinks are working correctly:

```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

Both should return `Python 3.10.x`.

## Step 6: Managing Multiple Environments
To manage multiple Python environments effectively, consider using a tool like `uv` (a faster alternative to `virtualenv` and `pip`). Install `uv` using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```

Then, create and activate a virtual environment with `uv`:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now, you can install packages and work within this environment without affecting your system-wide Python setup.

## Additional Tips
- **Use `uv` for faster package management and environment creation.**
- **Consider using `pyenv` if you need to switch between multiple Python versions frequently.**
- **Always be cautious when modifying system paths and ensure you have backups or can revert changes if needed.**

By following these steps, you'll have a unified Python experience on your Mac, with the flexibility to use different versions as needed.
