Here are ten more LaTeX equations to test your math parser, formatted in Markdown with LaTeX syntax:

1. **Euler's Formula for Polyhedra:**
   \[
   V - E + F = 2
   \]
   where \( V \) is the number of vertices, \( E \) is the number of edges, and \( F \) is the number of faces.

2. **Law of Cosines:**
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
   \]
   where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and \( C \) is the angle opposite side \( c \).

3. **Standard Deviation Formula:**
   \[
   \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
   \]
   where \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation, \( N \) is the number of observations, \( x_i \) are the observations, and \( \mu \) is the mean.

4. **Compound Interest Formula:**
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( n \) years, including interest, \( P \) is the principal amount, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

5. **Newton's Second Law of Motion:**
   \[
   F = ma
   \]
   where \( F \) is the force applied, \( m \) is the mass of the object, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

6. **Ideal Gas Law:**
   \[
   PV = nRT
   \]
   where \( P \) is the pressure of the gas, \( V \) is the volume, \( n \) is the amount of substance, \( R \) is the ideal gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

7. **Ohm's Law:**
   \[
   V = IR
   \]
   where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance.

8. **Sine Rule:**
   \[
   \frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
   \]
   where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the opposite angles.

9. **Logarithmic Identity:**
   \[
   \log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive real numbers, \( b 
eq 1 \), and \( c \) is any real number.

10. **Taylor Series Expansion:**
    \[
    f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots
    \]
    where \( f(x) \) is the function being expanded, \( a \) is the point about which the series is expanded, and \( f'(a) \), \( f''(a) \), \( f'''(a) \), etc., are the first, second, third, etc., derivatives of \( f \) evaluated at \( a \).
