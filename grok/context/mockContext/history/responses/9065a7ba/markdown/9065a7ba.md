To run a Node.js command instead of using `eval` for executing JavaScript code, you can modify the server code to use the `child_process` module. This approach is safer than using `eval` because it runs the code in a separate process, reducing the risk of executing harmful code directly in the server's context. Here's how you can adjust your server code to achieve this:

### Step 1: Modify server.js

Open `server.js` and replace the line where you execute the JavaScript code with the following code snippet:

```javascript
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// ...

try {
  // Execute the JavaScript code using Node.js
  const result = execSync(`node -e "${code}"`, { encoding: 'utf-8' });
  
  // Write the result to a file
  const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt');
  fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, result);

  // Send the file back to the client
  res.download(outputPath, 'output.txt');
} catch (error) {
  res.status(500).send(`Error executing code: ${error.message}`);
}
// The rest of the code remains the same
```

### Step 2: Test the Server

After making these changes, restart your server and test it using the same `curl` command as before:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/?code=const%20message%20=%20'hello%20world!'%3B%20console.log(message)"
```

This should download a file named `output.txt` with the content `hello world!`.

### Notes:

- **Security**: While using `child_process.execSync` is safer than `eval`, it still allows running arbitrary code. Ensure this is used only in a controlled environment or for educational purposes.
- **Error Handling**: The server now catches errors from the Node.js execution and sends them back to the client.
- **File Management**: The handling of the output file remains the same, creating and then deleting it after sending.

This setup will allow you to send a GET request to the server with a `code` query parameter, execute that code using Node.js, write the result to a file, and then send that file back to the client.
