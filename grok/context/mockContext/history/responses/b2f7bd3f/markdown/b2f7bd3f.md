# XGBoost Implementation Language

XGBoost is primarily implemented in **C++** for its core functionality, which allows for high performance and efficiency. Additionally, XGBoost has wrappers for various programming languages to facilitate its use in different environments:

- **Python**: Through the `xgboost` package, which is widely used in data science and machine learning communities.
- **R**: With the `xgboost` package available on CRAN, popular among statisticians and R users.
- **Java**: Via the XGBoost4J package, useful for integration into Java-based systems.
- **Scala**: Supported through XGBoost4J-Spark, which is beneficial for big data applications.
- **Julia**: With the XGBoost.jl package, catering to the Julia programming community.

These wrappers make XGBoost accessible to a broad audience while maintaining the performance benefits of its C++ core.
