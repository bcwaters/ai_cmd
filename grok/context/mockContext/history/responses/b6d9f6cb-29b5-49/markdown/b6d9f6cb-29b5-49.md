# Remark LaTeX

Yes, there is a library called `remark-latex`. It is a plugin for the `remark` markdown processor that allows you to use LaTeX syntax within markdown files. This plugin is particularly useful for rendering mathematical equations and other LaTeX-formatted content directly within markdown documents.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [remark-latex GitHub repository](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown/tree/master/packages/remark-latex).
