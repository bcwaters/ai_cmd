# Attention Mechanism Equations

The attention mechanism in neural networks, especially in transformer models, can be described with the following equations:

1. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:**
   \[
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
   \]
   where \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) are the query, key, and value matrices, respectively, and \(d_k\) is the dimension of the key vectors.

2. **Multi-Head Attention:**
   \[
   \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
   \]
   where each \(\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)\) and \(W_i^Q\), \(W_i^K\), \(W_i^V\), and \(W^O\) are parameter matrices.

# Feed Forward Neural Network Equations

The feed-forward neural network in transformers typically consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between:

\[
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{max}(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
\]
where \(W_1\), \(W_2\), \(b_1\), and \(b_2\) are learned weights and biases.

# Layer Normalization Equations

Layer normalization is used to normalize the inputs across the features. The equation is:

\[
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \frac{x - \text{E}[x]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} \cdot \gamma + \beta
\]
where \(\text{E}[x]\) and \(\text{Var}[x]\) are the mean and variance of \(x\), \(\epsilon\) is a small constant for numerical stability, and \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) are learnable scale and shift parameters.

# Residual Connection

The residual connection, or skip connection, is added directly to the output of a layer:

\[
y = \text{Layer}(x) + x
\]
where \(\text{Layer}(x)\) represents the output of any layer (e.g., attention, feed-forward) and \(x\) is the input to that layer.
