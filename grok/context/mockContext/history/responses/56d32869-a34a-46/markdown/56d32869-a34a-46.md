# JavaScript Libraries for Parsing LaTeX into Images

There are several JavaScript libraries that can parse LaTeX and convert it into visually appealing images. Here are some notable options:

### 1. **MathJax**
MathJax is a widely-used JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation. It can render LaTeX equations directly within the browser and can also be used to generate images.

- **Usage**: Include MathJax in your HTML file and use LaTeX syntax within your content.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js'></script>
  ```
  ```latex
  \[
  \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
  \]
  ```

### 2. **KaTeX**
KaTeX is another fast and lightweight math typesetting library designed for the web. It's known for its speed and can be used to generate images from LaTeX.

- **Usage**: Include KaTeX in your HTML and use LaTeX syntax.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.css">
  <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.js"></script>
  ```
  ```latex
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
  \]
  ```

### 3. **Prince**
Prince is a proprietary tool that can convert HTML (with embedded LaTeX) to PDF, which can be useful for generating high-quality images.

- **Usage**: You would typically use Prince on the server-side to convert LaTeX to PDF, then extract images.
- **Example**: 
  ```html
  <html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="prince-latex.css" type="text/css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="latex">\[
      E = mc^2
    \]</div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### 4. **jsMath**
jsMath is an older library that can render LaTeX in the browser and can be used to generate images.

- **Usage**: Include jsMath in your HTML and use LaTeX syntax.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="jsMath/jsMath.js"></script>
  ```
  ```latex
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
  \]
  ```

These libraries can be integrated into web applications to parse LaTeX and generate visually appealing images, enhancing the presentation of mathematical content.
