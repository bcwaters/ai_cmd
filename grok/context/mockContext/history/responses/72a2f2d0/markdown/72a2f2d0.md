# Does `string.trim()` Remove New Lines?

The `string.trim()` method in JavaScript removes whitespace from both ends of a string. This includes spaces, tabs, and new lines. However, it only removes these characters if they are at the start or the end of the string, not if they are in the middle.

Here's an example to illustrate:

```javascript
let str = "
 Hello World 
";
console.log(str.trim()); // Output: "Hello World"
```

In this example, the new lines at the beginning and end of the string are removed, but any new lines within the string would remain.

# Regular Expression to Ensure a Sentence Does Not Begin with Any Type of White Space

To ensure that a sentence does not begin with any type of white space (including spaces, tabs, and new lines), you can use a regular expression to check and remove leading whitespace. Here is a suitable regular expression:

```javascript
let sentence = "   This is a test sentence.";
let regex = /^\s+/;
let result = sentence.replace(regex, '');
console.log(result); // Output: "This is a test sentence."
```

Explanation:
- `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
- `\s+` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, new lines) one or more times.

This regular expression, when used with the `replace` method, will remove any leading whitespace from the sentence, ensuring it does not begin with any type of white space.
