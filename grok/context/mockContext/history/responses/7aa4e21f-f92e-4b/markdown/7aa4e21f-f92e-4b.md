Here are four LaTeX equations that you can use to test your parser. These are not inline and are formatted as display equations:

```latex
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}
```

These equations represent:

1. **Einstein's mass-energy equivalence** - A fundamental principle in physics.
2. **Pythagorean theorem** - A cornerstone in geometry for calculating the sides of a right triangle.
3. **Quadratic formula** - Used in algebra to find the roots of a quadratic equation.
4. **Area of a circle** - A basic formula in geometry for calculating the area of a circle.

These should provide a good test for your parser's ability to handle various mathematical expressions in LaTeX format.
