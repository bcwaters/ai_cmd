# Differences between remarkMath and KaTeX

**remarkMath** and **KaTeX** serve different roles within the ecosystem of parsing and rendering mathematical expressions, particularly in the context of Markdown processing.

### remarkMath

- **Purpose**: `remarkMath` is a plugin for the `remark` processor, which is used to parse Markdown. Its primary function is to identify and extract mathematical expressions written in LaTeX syntax from Markdown text.
- **Usage**: It is typically used as part of a processing pipeline in tools like `unified`, where it prepares the math expressions for further processing. It does not render the math; it simply recognizes and isolates it within the Markdown text.
- **Integration**: It is often used in conjunction with other plugins to convert Markdown to other formats, such as HTML, where the math can then be rendered.
- **Example**: In the context of the steps provided, `remarkMath` would be used to detect and mark LaTeX expressions in the Markdown, preparing them for subsequent rendering by a tool like KaTeX.

### KaTeX

- **Purpose**: KaTeX is a fast JavaScript library for rendering mathematical expressions on the web. It takes LaTeX expressions as input and outputs HTML and CSS to display the math.
- **Usage**: KaTeX is used to render the LaTeX expressions into visually appealing and correctly formatted mathematical symbols and equations. It is the rendering engine that actually displays the math on a webpage.
- **Integration**: In the setup described in the steps, KaTeX is used via the `rehype-katex` plugin, which applies KaTeX rendering to the HTML output after the Markdown has been converted to HTML.
- **Example**: In the provided code, `rehype-katex` is used to process the LaTeX expressions identified by `remarkMath` and convert them into HTML that can be displayed in a browser.

### Summary

- **remarkMath** identifies and isolates LaTeX expressions in Markdown, preparing them for rendering.
- **KaTeX** renders the LaTeX expressions into HTML and CSS for display on the web.

Both tools are essential in a pipeline for processing Markdown with embedded LaTeX, where `remarkMath` prepares the math for rendering, and KaTeX does the actual rendering.
