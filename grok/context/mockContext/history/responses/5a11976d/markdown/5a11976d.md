# Regex Concepts Applicable to Machine Learning

Here are three regex concepts that are particularly useful in the context of machine learning and related fields:

## 1. **Tokenization**
Regex can be used to tokenize text, which is a critical step in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks involving text data. Tokenization involves breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

```regex
\b\w+\b
```
This regex pattern matches word boundaries (`\b`) and one or more word characters (`\w+`), effectively tokenizing text into words.

## 2. **Feature Extraction**
Regex can help in extracting specific features from text, such as extracting numbers, dates, or specific patterns that are relevant to the machine learning model's features.

```regex
\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}
```
This regex pattern matches IP addresses, which could be a useful feature in certain machine learning applications like network security analysis.

## 3. **Data Cleaning**
Regex is crucial for cleaning and preprocessing text data, removing unwanted characters, or standardizing text format, which is essential before feeding data into machine learning models.

```regex
[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]
```
This regex pattern matches any character that is not a letter, number, or whitespace, allowing for the removal of special characters from text data.
