# Testing Audio Setup

It seems you are testing your audio setup with the phrase "testing one two." This is a common practice to ensure that microphones and speakers are functioning correctly. If you need further assistance with setting up or troubleshooting your audio equipment, feel free to ask.

### Follow-up Questions:
