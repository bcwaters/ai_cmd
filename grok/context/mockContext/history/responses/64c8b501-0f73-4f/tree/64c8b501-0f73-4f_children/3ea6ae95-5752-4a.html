<h1>Pythagorean Theorem: Detailed Explanation</h1>
<h2>The Formula</h2>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem is represented by the equation:
[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ]
where (a) and (b) are the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle, and (c) is the length of the hypotenuse, the side opposite the right angle.</p>
<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p>The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, though it was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier. It is one of the fundamental theorems in geometry.</p>
<h2>Proofs</h2>
<p>There are over 300 known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. One of the simplest is the geometric proof using similar triangles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider a right triangle with legs (a) and (b), and hypotenuse (c).</li>
<li>Draw a perpendicular from the right angle to the hypotenuse, dividing the original triangle into two smaller right triangles.</li>
<li>Each of these smaller triangles is similar to the original triangle.</li>
<li>Using the properties of similar triangles, the relationship (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) can be derived.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem is widely used in various fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture and Construction:</strong> To ensure that corners are square.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> For calculating distances in two-dimensional space.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> In the design of structures and machinery.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Graphics:</strong> For rendering and calculating distances in 3D spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solving for Sides</h2>
<p>To find the length of any side of a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known:</p>
<ul>
<li>If (a) and (b) are known, (c) can be calculated using (c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}).</li>
<li>If (a) and (c) are known, (b) can be calculated using (b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}).</li>
<li>If (b) and (c) are known, (a) can be calculated using (a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Generalizations</h2>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem has been generalized to higher dimensions and other geometries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three-Dimensional Space:</strong> The Pythagorean Theorem extends to three dimensions as (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2), where (d) is the diagonal of a rectangular box.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Euclidean Geometry:</strong> In hyperbolic and spherical geometries, the theorem takes different forms.</li>
</ul>
