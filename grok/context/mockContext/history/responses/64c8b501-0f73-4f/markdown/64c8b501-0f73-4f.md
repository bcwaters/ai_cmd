Here are two common mathematical equations:

1. **Quadratic Equation:**
   \[
   ax^2 + bx + c = 0
   \]
   This equation is used to solve for \(x\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(a 
eq 0\).

2. **Pythagorean Theorem:**
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   This equation is used in geometry to find the length of the hypotenuse \(c\) of a right triangle, where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the other two sides.
