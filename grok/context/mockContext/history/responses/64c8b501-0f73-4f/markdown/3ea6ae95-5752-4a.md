# Pythagorean Theorem: Detailed Explanation

## The Formula
The Pythagorean Theorem is represented by the equation:
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, the side opposite the right angle.

## Historical Context
The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, though it was known to the Babylonians 1000 years earlier. It is one of the fundamental theorems in geometry.

## Proofs
There are over 300 known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. One of the simplest is the geometric proof using similar triangles:
- Consider a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\).
- Draw a perpendicular from the right angle to the hypotenuse, dividing the original triangle into two smaller right triangles.
- Each of these smaller triangles is similar to the original triangle.
- Using the properties of similar triangles, the relationship \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) can be derived.

## Applications
The Pythagorean Theorem is widely used in various fields:
- **Architecture and Construction:** To ensure that corners are square.
- **Navigation:** For calculating distances in two-dimensional space.
- **Engineering:** In the design of structures and machinery.
- **Computer Graphics:** For rendering and calculating distances in 3D spaces.

## Solving for Sides
To find the length of any side of a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known:
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are known, \(c\) can be calculated using \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).
- If \(a\) and \(c\) are known, \(b\) can be calculated using \(b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}\).
- If \(b\) and \(c\) are known, \(a\) can be calculated using \(a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}\).

## Generalizations
The Pythagorean Theorem has been generalized to higher dimensions and other geometries:
- **Three-Dimensional Space:** The Pythagorean Theorem extends to three dimensions as \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2\), where \(d\) is the diagonal of a rectangular box.
- **Non-Euclidean Geometry:** In hyperbolic and spherical geometries, the theorem takes different forms.
