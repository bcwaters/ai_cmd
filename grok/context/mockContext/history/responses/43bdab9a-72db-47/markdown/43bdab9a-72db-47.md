# Representing a Shell Command with Multiple Input Arguments

To represent a shell command with multiple input arguments in documentation or markdown, you can use the following format:

```bash
command arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Here, `command` is the shell command you want to execute, and `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3` represent the multiple arguments you pass to the command. 

For example, if you want to use the `ls` command to list files with detailed information (`-l` flag) and in reverse chronological order (`-r` flag), it would look like this:

```bash
ls -l -r
```

Or, if you're using a command like `grep` to search for a pattern (`pattern`) in multiple files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`), it would be represented as:

```bash
grep pattern file1.txt file2.txt
```

This format clearly shows the command followed by its arguments, making it easy to understand and replicate in a shell environment.
