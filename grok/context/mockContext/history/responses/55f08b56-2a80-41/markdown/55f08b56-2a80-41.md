In LaTeX and Markdown with KaTeX integration, you can use different syntaxes to denote math expressions. Here's how you can use them:

### Markdown with KaTeX (Using `$` and `$$`)

For inline math, you use single dollar signs `$...$`. For display math (centered and on its own line), you use double dollar signs `$$...$$`.

#### Inline Math
```markdown
The quadratic formula is given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
```

#### Display Math
```markdown
The Pythagorean theorem can be written as:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

### Plain LaTeX (Using `\( ... \)` and `\[ ... \]`) 

In plain LaTeX, inline math is denoted by `\( ... \)`, and display math is denoted by `\[ ... \]`.

#### Inline Math
```latex
The quadratic formula is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).
```

#### Display Math
```latex
The Pythagorean theorem can be written as:
\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
```

### Notes

- **Markdown with KaTeX**: This is typically used in web-based Markdown editors or in systems where Markdown is rendered into HTML with math support.
- **Plain LaTeX**: This is used in LaTeX documents, which are typically compiled into PDF or other formats.

Both methods support the same LaTeX syntax for writing equations but use different delimiters to indicate where the math starts and ends.
