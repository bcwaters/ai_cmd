The manor is a large, gloomy house surrounded by extensive grounds, including the titular secret garden.</p>
<p><strong>The Secret Garden:</strong>
The garden itself is a crucial element of the story. It is initially described as a hidden, neglected space behind a locked door, covered in ivy and overgrown with weeds.

<p><strong>Mary Lennox:</strong>
Mary is a key character whose physical and emotional journey is intertwined with the garden.

As she spends more time in the garden, her health improves, and she becomes more vibrant and lively.</p>
<p><strong>Colin Craven:</strong>
Colin, Mary's cousin, is another character whose physical transformation is linked to the garden. He is initially bedridden and believed to be chronically ill. As he joins Mary and Dickon in the garden, his health improves significantly, and he becomes stronger and more active.</p>
<p><strong>The Manor and Its Grounds:</strong>
Misselthwaite Manor itself is described as a large, old house with many rooms and corridors.
