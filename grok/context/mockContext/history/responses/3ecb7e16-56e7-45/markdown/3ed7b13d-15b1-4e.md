## In Nature: Detailed Exploration

### **The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett**

**Setting and Transformation:**
- The novel "The Secret Garden" is set in the Yorkshire moors, a natural environment that plays a pivotal role in the story's development. The secret garden itself is a secluded part of the estate, initially described as neglected and overgrown with weeds and dead plants.
- As Mary Lennox begins to tend to the garden, the transformation is meticulously detailed. The garden's revival is marked by the emergence of green shoots and vibrant foliage, symbolizing the rejuvenation of the land and the characters.
- The natural setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative. The changing seasons, from winter to spring, mirror the internal growth of the characters, with the green of new life becoming more prominent as the story progresses.

**Connection with Nature:**
- The garden serves as a sanctuary where Mary, Colin, and Dickon can connect deeply with nature. The act of gardening becomes a therapeutic process, fostering a sense of peace and healing.
- Descriptions of the natural world are lush and vivid, with Burnett using sensory details to immerse readers in the experience. For example, the scent of flowers, the sound of birds, and the feel of the earth under their hands are all highlighted.
- The garden's transformation from a barren space to a thriving green oasis underscores the theme of nature's healing power. This is evident in how the characters' physical and mental health improve as they spend more time in the garden.

**Symbolism of Green:**
- The color green in "The Secret Garden" is a symbol of life, hope, and renewal. It represents the potential for growth and transformation, both in the garden and in the lives of the characters.
- The greening of the garden parallels the emotional and psychological growth of Mary and Colin, illustrating how nature can facilitate personal development and healing.

### **The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald**

**Setting and Symbolism:**
- While "The Great Gatsby" is primarily set in the bustling, urban environment of New York, the natural element of the green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a crucial symbol.
- The green light is visible across the water from Gatsby's mansion, situated in the more natural setting of Long Island. This natural element contrasts with the artificiality and excess of the city, highlighting the novel's themes.

**The Green Light:**
- The green light symbolizes Gatsby's hopes and dreams, specifically his longing to reunite with Daisy. It is a natural element that stands in stark contrast to the man-made wealth and status Gatsby pursues.
- The light's green color is significant, often associated with nature, growth, and renewal, yet in this context, it also represents the unattainable nature of Gatsby's dreams.
- The natural setting of the green light juxtaposed against the backdrop of the city underscores the tension between nature and the artificial world of wealth and status.

**Nature's Role in the Narrative:**
- Although the novel is not deeply rooted in nature like "The Secret Garden," the green light serves as a reminder of the natural world's presence and its symbolic importance.
- The green light's natural setting on the dock and its visibility from Gatsby's mansion create a poignant image that encapsulates the novel's themes of aspiration and the elusive American Dream.

In both novels, the color green and its association with nature play significant roles in conveying deeper themes and symbolism. "The Secret Garden" uses the greening of the garden to illustrate themes of healing and growth, while "The Great Gatsby" uses the green light to represent the unreachable nature of dreams and the critique of societal values.
