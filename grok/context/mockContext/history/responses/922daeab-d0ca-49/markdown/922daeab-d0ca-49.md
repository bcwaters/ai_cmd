To set up an Express server that suppresses logs, processes command-line arguments, and handles JSON endpoints, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Setup and Installation

First, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, initialize a new Node.js project and install Express:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

### Step 2: Creating the Server Script

Create a file named `server.js`. Here's a basic setup to handle JSON endpoints with suppressed logs:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.argv[2] || 3000; // Command-line argument for port, default to 3000

// Suppress Express logs
app.set('logger', false);

// Middleware to parse JSON
app.use(express.json());

// Example JSON endpoint
app.get('/fruits', (req, res) => {
    const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
    res.json(fruits);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
    // Suppress console.log
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
        console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
    }
});
```

### Step 3: Running the Script

To run the script and specify the port, use:

```bash
node server.js 4000
```

This will start the server on port 4000, and logs will be suppressed in a production environment.

### Step 4: Testing the Endpoint

You can test the `/fruits` endpoint using a tool like `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/fruits
```

This should return the JSON response `["apple", "banana"]`.
