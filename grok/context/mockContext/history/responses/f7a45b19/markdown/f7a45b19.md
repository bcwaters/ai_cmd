To keep a Docker container running for diagnostic purposes, you can use a command that runs indefinitely. Here are a few options:

### Using `sleep infinity`

This command will keep the container running indefinitely. It's useful for diagnostics because it doesn't consume much resources.

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name diagnostic-container your-image-name sleep infinity
```

### Using `/bin/bash`

If the image has `/bin/bash`, you can start the container in an interactive mode to diagnose issues:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --name diagnostic-container your-image-name /bin/bash
```

### Using `/bin/sh`

If `/bin/bash` is not available, you can use `/bin/sh`:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --name diagnostic-container your-image-name /bin/sh
```

### Using `tail -f /dev/null`

Another command that keeps the container running without consuming much resources:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name diagnostic-container your-image-name tail -f /dev/null
```

Choose the command that best fits your diagnostic needs. If you need to attach to a running container later, you can use `docker exec`:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it diagnostic-container /bin/bash
```

or

```bash
sudo docker exec -it diagnostic-container /bin/sh
```
