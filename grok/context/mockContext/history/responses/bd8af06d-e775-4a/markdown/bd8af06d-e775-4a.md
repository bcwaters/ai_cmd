# Setting Up MathJax

To set up MathJax on your website, follow these steps:

1. **Include MathJax in Your Webpage:**
   Add the following script tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML document to include MathJax from a CDN:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Configure MathJax:**
   You can configure MathJax by adding a configuration script before the MathJax script. Here's a basic configuration:

   ```html
   <script>
     window.MathJax = {
       tex: {
         inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ["\\(", "\\)"]]
       }
     };
   </script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Write Your Math Equations:**
   Now you can write math equations in your HTML using the delimiters you configured. For example:

   ```html
   <p>Here is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.</p>
   <p>And here is a displayed equation: $$E = mc^2$$</p>
   ```

4. **Testing Your Setup:**
   Load your webpage in a browser to see if the equations are rendered correctly. If they are not, check your console for any errors and ensure that the MathJax script is loaded properly.

By following these steps, you should have MathJax set up and ready to use on your website.
