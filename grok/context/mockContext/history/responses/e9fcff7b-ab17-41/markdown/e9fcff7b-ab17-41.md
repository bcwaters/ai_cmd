# Who is Mel Fischer?

Mel Fischer was an American treasure hunter and engineer, best known for his discoveries of shipwrecks in the Florida Keys. Born on March 2, 1942, in Indiana, Fischer became fascinated with treasure hunting at a young age. He moved to Florida in the 1960s and began his career as a salvage operator.

Fischer's most notable achievement was the discovery of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha, a Spanish galleon that sank in 1622 off the coast of Florida. The Atocha was carrying a vast treasure of gold, silver, and gems when it went down during a hurricane. After years of searching, Fischer and his team located the main treasure of the Atocha in 1985, which included over 40 tons of silver and gold, as well as numerous emeralds.

Throughout his career, Mel Fischer continued to search for and recover treasures from other shipwrecks, contributing significantly to the field of underwater archaeology. He passed away on December 19, 1998, but his legacy lives on through the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida, which showcases artifacts from his discoveries and educates the public about maritime history and the science of treasure hunting.
