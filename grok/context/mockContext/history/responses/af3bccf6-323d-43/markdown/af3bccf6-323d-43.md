In Markdown, to enable syntax highlighting for code blocks, you need to declare the language right after the opening triple backticks (```). Here's how you do it:

```markdown
```language
your code here
```
```

For example, if you want to highlight JavaScript code, you would write:

```markdown
```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```
```

This tells the Markdown renderer to apply JavaScript syntax highlighting to the code block. The same principle applies to other languages like Python, HTML, CSS, etc., by replacing `javascript` with the appropriate language identifier.
