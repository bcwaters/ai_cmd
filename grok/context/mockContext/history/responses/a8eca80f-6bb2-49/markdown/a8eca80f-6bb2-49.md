Here are some lines of Python code that implement the softmax function, based on the explanation provided earlier:

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
    # Exponentiate each element in the input vector z
    exp_z = np.exp(z)
    
    # Normalize by dividing each exponentiated value by the sum of all exponentiated values
    softmax_output = exp_z / np.sum(exp_z)
    
    return softmax_output

# Example usage
z = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
result = softmax(z)
print("Softmax output:", result)
```

This code demonstrates the implementation of the softmax function, including exponentiation and normalization steps as described in the explanation.
