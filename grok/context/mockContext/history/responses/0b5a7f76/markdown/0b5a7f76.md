To force your local branch to match the `origin/master` branch, you can use the following Git command:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/master
```

This command will:

1. **Reset** your current branch to match the `origin/master` branch.
2. **Force** the reset with the `--hard` option, which discards all local changes and moves the branch pointer to the specified commit.

**Warning:** Using `git reset --hard` will permanently delete any uncommitted changes in your working directory and staging area. Make sure to commit or stash any important changes before running this command.

If you want to keep your local commits but still force your branch to match `origin/master`, you can use:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge --ff-only origin/master
```

This approach will:
1. **Fetch** the latest changes from the remote repository.
2. **Merge** the `origin/master` branch into your current branch, but only if it can be done as a fast-forward (i.e., if your local branch is behind `origin/master` and there are no divergent changes).

Remember to be cautious when forcing your local branch to match a remote branch, as it can lead to loss of work if not done carefully.
