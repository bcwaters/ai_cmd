Here are some examples of mathematical expressions using LaTeX in Markdown format:

### Equilateral Triangle
- **Area of an Equilateral Triangle**:
  \[
  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
  \]
  where \( s \) is the length of a side.

- **Perimeter of an Equilateral Triangle**:
  \[
  P = 3s
  \]

### Isosceles Triangle
- **Area of an Isosceles Triangle**:
  If the base \( b \) and the height \( h \) from the base to the opposite vertex are known:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} b h
  \]

- **Perimeter of an Isosceles Triangle**:
  If the two equal sides are \( a \) and the base is \( b \):
  \[
  P = 2a + b
  \]

### Obtuse Triangle
- **Using the Law of Cosines to find a side**:
  If \( a \), \( b \), and \( C \) are known, where \( C \) is the obtuse angle:
  \[
  c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)}
  \]
  where \( c \) is the side opposite angle \( C \).

- **Using the Law of Sines**:
  To find an angle or a side in an obtuse triangle:
  \[
  \frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
  \]

These formulas and examples showcase how LaTeX can be used to express geometric properties and calculations in a clear and precise manner.
