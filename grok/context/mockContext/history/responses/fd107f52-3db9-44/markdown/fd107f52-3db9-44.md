# Testing in Markdown

In Markdown, testing typically refers to the process of verifying that the formatting and content display as intended across different platforms and devices. Here's a brief guide on how to test Markdown:

1. **Local Preview**: Use a Markdown editor or a text editor with Markdown preview capabilities to see how your document will look.
2. **Online Renderers**: Websites like GitHub or StackEdit can render Markdown to check its appearance.
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure that your Markdown looks good on different devices and browsers.

If you're testing specific Markdown features, consider the following:

- **Headers**: Use `#` for headers and check if they are displayed correctly.
- **Lists**: Ensure bullet points and numbered lists are formatted as expected.
- **Links and Images**: Verify that links work and images are displayed properly.
