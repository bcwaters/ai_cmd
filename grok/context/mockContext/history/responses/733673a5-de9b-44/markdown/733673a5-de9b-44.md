# Number Theory Proofs

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. Here are some fundamental proofs in number theory, presented using LaTeX for clarity.

## 1. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

**Theorem:** Every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers, and this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors.

**Proof:** 

- **Existence:** We can prove the existence of a prime factorization by induction. For $n = 2$, $n$ is prime. Suppose every integer up to $n$ has a prime factorization. If $n+1$ is prime, we are done. If not, $n+1 = ab$ where $1 < a, b < n+1$. By the induction hypothesis, $a$ and $b$ have prime factorizations, so $n+1$ does too.
- **Uniqueness:** Suppose $n$ has two distinct prime factorizations. Then, there exist primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ and $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_m$ such that $n = p_1p_2\ldots p_k = q_1q_2\ldots q_m$. By the properties of prime numbers, $p_1$ must divide one of the $q_i$'s. Since $p_1$ is prime, $p_1 = q_i$ for some $i$. Cancel $p_1$ and $q_i$ from both sides and repeat the process until all primes are matched, proving uniqueness.

## 2. Euclid's Lemma

**Theorem:** If a prime number $p$ divides the product of two integers $a$ and $b$, then $p$ must divide at least one of them.

**Proof:**

Assume $p$ divides $ab$ but does not divide $a$. We need to show that $p$ must divide $b$. Since $p$ does not divide $a$, $a$ and $p$ are coprime, i.e., $\gcd(a, p) = 1$. By the BÃ©zout's identity, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + py = 1$. Multiplying both sides by $b$, we get $abx + pby = b$. Since $p$ divides $ab$, $p$ divides $abx$. Also, $p$ divides $pby$. Therefore, $p$ divides $abx + pby = b$, proving the lemma.

## 3. Fermat's Little Theorem

**Theorem:** If $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

**Proof:**

Consider the set $S = \{a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p-1)a\}$. Since $p$ is prime, no two elements of $S$ are congruent modulo $p$. Therefore, $S$ is a permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1\}$. The product of all elements in $S$ is congruent to the product of all elements in $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1\}$ modulo $p$. Thus, $a \cdot 2a \cdot 3a \cdots (p-1)a \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (p-1) \pmod{p}$. Simplifying, we get $a^{p-1}(p-1)! \equiv (p-1)! \pmod{p}$. Since $(p-1)!$ is not divisible by $p$, we can cancel it from both sides to get $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

These proofs illustrate the elegance and depth of number theory, showcasing how fundamental principles can lead to profound insights into the nature of numbers.
