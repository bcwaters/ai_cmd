# Testing in Markdown

Here is a simple example of how to format a test case in Markdown:

```markdown
### Test Case 1: Basic Functionality

**Description:** Verify that the function returns the correct output for a standard input.

**Input:** `5`

**Expected Output:** `10`

**Actual Output:** `10`

**Result:** Pass
```

This format helps in clearly documenting and reviewing test cases.

Is there anything specific you would like to know about testing, or any particular type of test you're interested in?
