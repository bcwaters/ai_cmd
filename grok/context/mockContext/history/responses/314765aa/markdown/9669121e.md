### URL Validation Regex Pattern

**Regex Pattern:** `regexhttps?://[a-z0-9.-]+/[a-z0-9-._~:/?#[\]@!$&'()*+,;=]*$`

**Explanation:** This regex pattern is used to validate URLs. Let's break down its components and functionality:

- **Protocol:** `https?://` - This part of the regex checks for the presence of either `http://` or `https://` at the beginning of the URL. The `?` after `s` makes it optional, allowing for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
  
- **Domain Name:** `[a-z0-9.-]+` - This segment validates the domain name of the URL. It allows for alphanumeric characters (`a-z0-9`), dots (`.`), and hyphens (`-`). The `+` indicates that at least one of these characters must be present.

- **Path and Query:** `/[a-z0-9-._~:/?#[\]@!$&'()*+,;=]*$` - This part checks for any path or query string following the domain name. It allows for a wide range of characters that are commonly used in URLs, such as letters, numbers, and various special characters. The `*` at the end indicates that these characters can appear zero or more times, and the `$` ensures that the pattern matches until the end of the string.

**Usage:** This pattern can be used in various programming languages and tools to ensure that a given string meets the criteria for a properly formatted URL. It's particularly useful in web development for validating user input, filtering data, or ensuring that links within a website or application are correctly formatted.

**Example Use Case:** When a user submits a URL on a website, this regex can be applied to check if the input is a valid URL. If the URL passes the validation, the website can proceed to process it further, perhaps by redirecting to the URL or storing it in a database. If the URL fails the validation, the website can prompt the user to enter a correctly formatted URL.

By using this regex pattern, developers can ensure that their applications handle URLs correctly, enhancing user experience and maintaining data integrity.
