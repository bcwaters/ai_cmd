Here are three useful regular expressions for ensuring a properly formatted string, along with explanations of their uses:

### 1. Email Validation

**Regex Pattern:**
```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

**Explanation:**
This regex pattern is used to validate email addresses. It ensures that the string contains:
- One or more characters for the username part (before the `@`), which can include letters, numbers, and certain special characters (`._%+-`).
- An `@` symbol separating the username from the domain.
- One or more characters for the domain part, which can include letters, numbers, and dots (`.`).
- A dot (`.`) followed by the top-level domain, which must be at least two characters long.

**Use Case:**
To check if an input string is a valid email address.

### 2. Password Strength

**Regex Pattern:**
```regex
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])[A-Za-z\d!@#$%^&*]{8,}$
```

**Explanation:**
This regex pattern is designed to check for password strength. It ensures that the password:
- Contains at least one lowercase letter (`[a-z]`).
- Contains at least one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`).
- Contains at least one digit (`\d`).
- Contains at least one special character from the set `!@#$%^&*`.
- Is at least 8 characters long.

**Use Case:**
To enforce a strong password policy, ensuring the password meets complexity requirements.

### 3. URL Validation

**Regex Pattern:**
```regex
^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$
```

**Explanation:**
This regex pattern is used to validate URLs. It checks for:
- An optional `http://` or `https://` at the beginning.
- A domain name composed of letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.
- A top-level domain (TLD) of 2 to 6 characters.
- An optional path after the domain, which can include letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, and slashes.

**Use Case:**
To validate whether an input string is a properly formatted URL.

These regex patterns can be used in various programming languages and tools to ensure that strings meet specific formatting criteria.
