# LaTeX Equations Examples

Here are some examples of common mathematical equations written in LaTeX format:

1. **Softmax Function**
   The softmax function is often used in machine learning, particularly in classification problems, to convert a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution.
   $$
   \text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^k e^{x_j}}
   $$

2. **Exponential Function**
   The exponential function is a fundamental function in mathematics, used extensively in various fields including physics, finance, and biology.
   $$
   e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}
   $$

3. **Vector Normalization**
   Vector normalization is a process to convert a vector into a unit vector, which is useful in many applications such as computer graphics and machine learning.
   $$
   \hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
   $$

4. **Pythagorean Theorem**
   The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.
   $$
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   $$

5. **Quadratic Formula**
   The quadratic formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
   $$
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   $$

6. **Circle Area**
   The formula to calculate the area of a circle is derived from the concept of $\pi$.
   $$
   A = \pi r^2
   $$

7. **Sphere Volume**
   The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the following formula:
   $$
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   $$

8. **Slope Formula**
   The slope of a line between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
   $$
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   $$

9. **Euler's Identity**
   Euler's identity is often considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics:
   $$
   e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
   $$

10. **Binomial Theorem**
    The binomial theorem describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial.
    $$
    (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
    $$

11. **Derivative of a Function**
    The derivative of a function $f(x)$ represents the rate of change of the function with respect to $x$.
    $$
    f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
    $$

12. **Integral of a Function**
    The integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is the area under the curve of $f(x)$.
    $$
    \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
    $$

13. **Limit of a Function**
    The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a certain value $c$ is defined as:
    $$
    \lim_{x \to c} f(x)
    $$
