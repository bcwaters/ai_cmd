Here are some more KaTeX equations related to number theory:

### Number Theory Equations

1. **Euler's Totient Function:**
   The Euler's Totient function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, counts the positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.
   \[
   \phi(n) = n \prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)
   \]
   where the product is over all distinct prime numbers $p$ dividing $n$.

2. **Fermat's Little Theorem:**
   Fermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, we have:
   \[
   a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
   \]
   And if $a$ is divisible by $p$, then:
   \[
   a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}
   \]

3. **Chinese Remainder Theorem:**
   The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer $n$ by several pairwise coprime integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of $n$ by the product of these integers. For two coprime moduli $m_1$ and $m_2$, if:
   \[
   n \equiv a_1 \pmod{m_1} \quad \text{and} \quad n \equiv a_2 \pmod{m_2}
   \]
   then there exists a unique solution modulo $m_1 m_2$:
   \[
   n \equiv x \pmod{m_1 m_2}
   \]
   where $x$ can be found using:
   \[
   x = a_1 M_2 y_2 + a_2 M_1 y_1
   \]
   with $M_1 = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1}$, $M_2 = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_2}$, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to:
   \[
   M_1 y_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{m_1} \quad \text{and} \quad M_2 y_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{m_2}
   \]

4. **Sum of Divisors Function:**
   The sum of the divisors of a number $n$, denoted as $\sigma(n)$, is given by:
   \[
   \sigma(n) = \sum_{d|n} d
   \]
   where the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.

5. **Perfect Number:**
   A number $n$ is called perfect if it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. A perfect number can be expressed as:
   \[
   n = \sigma(n) - n
   \]
   where $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of all divisors of $n$.
