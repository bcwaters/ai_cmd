# Number Theory: Sum of Numbers Divisible by 3

In number theory, a fascinating property of numbers divisible by 3 is that their sum is also divisible by 3. Let's explore the mathematical reasoning behind this phenomenon.

## Mathematical Proof

Consider a set of integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$ where each $a_i$ is divisible by 3. This can be expressed as:
\[ a_i = 3k_i \]
for some integer $k_i$.

The sum of these numbers can be written as:
\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_n \]
Substituting the expression for each $a_i$:
\[ S = 3k_1 + 3k_2 + 3k_3 + ... + 3k_n \]

We can factor out the 3 from the sum:
\[ S = 3(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + ... + k_n) \]

Let \( T = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + ... + k_n \), which is an integer. Therefore, the sum \( S \) can be expressed as:
\[ S = 3T \]

Since \( S \) is expressed as \( 3 \) times an integer \( T \), \( S \) is divisible by 3.

## Conclusion

This proof demonstrates that the sum of any set of numbers divisible by 3 will itself be divisible by 3. This property holds true for any finite set of such numbers and is a fundamental concept in number theory.
