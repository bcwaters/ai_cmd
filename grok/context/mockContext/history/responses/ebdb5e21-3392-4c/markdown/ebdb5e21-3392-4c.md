To demonstrate two parsers for LaTeX in the unified ecosystem, we'll look at `rehype-katex` and `remark-math`. These are plugins that can be used within the unified processor to handle LaTeX math expressions. Here's how you might use them:

### 1. rehype-katex

`rehype-katex` is a rehype plugin that converts LaTeX math in HTML to KaTeX, which is a fast LaTeX rendering library. It's particularly useful for rendering math on the web.

```javascript
const unified = require('unified')
const parse = require('rehype-parse')
const katex = require('rehype-katex')
const stringify = require('rehype-stringify')

unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(katex)
  .use(stringify)
  .process('<p>$E=mc^2$</p>', (err, file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

This example processes HTML containing LaTeX math and outputs HTML with the math rendered by KaTeX.

### 2. remark-math

`remark-math` is a remark plugin that allows you to use LaTeX math syntax in Markdown. It's useful for processing Markdown documents that contain mathematical expressions.

```javascript
const unified = require('unified')
const parse = require('remark-parse')
const math = require('remark-math')
const katex = require('rehype-katex')
const remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
const stringify = require('rehype-stringify')

unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(math)
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(katex)
  .use(stringify)
  .process('Inline math: $E=mc^2$. Display math: $$E=mc^2$$', (err, file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

This example processes a Markdown string with LaTeX math and outputs HTML with the math rendered by KaTeX.

Both of these plugins are part of the unified ecosystem and can be combined with other plugins to create a full processing pipeline for documents containing LaTeX math.

- Do you need help integrating these plugins into a larger project?
- Are you interested in learning about other plugins that can be used with LaTeX in unified?
- Would you like to see examples of how these plugins handle more complex LaTeX expressions?
