To add Remark LaTeX to your unified pipeline, you'll need to integrate a LaTeX renderer into your existing setup. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You'll need `remark` for processing Markdown and a LaTeX renderer like `remark-math` or `remark-latex`.

```bash
npm install remark remark-math
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Pipeline

Next, configure your pipeline to use these plugins. Here's an example of how to set up a simple pipeline with `remark` and `remark-math`:

```javascript
const unified = require('unified');
const remarkParse = require('remark-parse');
const remarkMath = require('remark-math');
const remarkStringify = require('remark-stringify');

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkMath)
  .use(remarkStringify);

// Example usage
const markdownWithMath = `
# Example

This is a simple equation: $E = mc^2$.
`;

processor.process(markdownWithMath, (err, file) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(String(file));
});
```

### Step 3: Customize the LaTeX Rendering

If you need more control over how LaTeX is rendered, you might want to use a different plugin or a custom solution. For instance, you could use `remark-latex` for more advanced LaTeX support.

```bash
npm install remark-latex
```

Then, modify your pipeline to use `remark-latex`:

```javascript
const remarkLatex = require('remark-latex');

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkLatex)
  .use(remarkStringify);
```

### Step 4: Test and Refine

After setting up the pipeline, test it with different LaTeX expressions to ensure they are rendered correctly. You may need to refine the configuration based on your specific needs, such as adjusting the LaTeX renderer settings or adding additional plugins for more complex mathematical expressions.

### Step 5: Integration with Your Existing Workflow

Finally, integrate this pipeline into your existing workflow. This might involve modifying build scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or other tools you use to process your documents.

By following these steps, you can successfully add Remark LaTeX to your unified pipeline, enabling you to render mathematical expressions within your Markdown documents.
