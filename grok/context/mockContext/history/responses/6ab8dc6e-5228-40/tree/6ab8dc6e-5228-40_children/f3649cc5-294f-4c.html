<h2>Linear Equation: ( y = 2x + 3 )</h2>
<h3>Equation Representation</h3>
<p>A linear equation in the form ( y = mx + b ) represents a straight line on a Cartesian plane. In this specific equation, ( y = 2x + 3 ):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>( m ) (slope):</strong> The coefficient of ( x ), which is 2, indicates the slope of the line. The slope describes how steep the line is and in which direction it is going. A positive slope of 2 means that for every unit increase in ( x ), ( y ) increases by 2 units.</li>
<li><strong>( b ) (y-intercept):</strong> The constant term, which is 3, represents the y-intercept. This is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, specifically at the point ((0, 3)).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graphical Interpretation</h3>
<p>When graphing ( y = 2x + 3 ):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starting Point:</strong> The line starts at the y-intercept, which is at ( y = 3 ) when ( x = 0 ).</li>
<li><strong>Direction and Steepness:</strong> The line will move upwards to the right because the slope is positive. The steepness is determined by the slope of 2, meaning the line will rise 2 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right.</li>
<li><strong>Example Points:</strong> To plot additional points, you can choose values of ( x ) and calculate ( y ):
<ul>
<li>If ( x = 1 ), then ( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 ). So, another point on the line is ((1, 5)).</li>
<li>If ( x = -1 ), then ( y = 2(-1) + 3 = 1 ). So, another point on the line is ((-1, 1)).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mathematical Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linearity:</strong> The equation is linear because the highest power of ( x ) is 1. This means the relationship between ( x ) and ( y ) is constant and does not change as ( x ) changes.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Solutions:</strong> A linear equation like ( y = 2x + 3 ) has an infinite number of solutions, each corresponding to a point on the line.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Lines:</strong> If another line has the same slope (2) but a different y-intercept, it will be parallel to ( y = 2x + 3 ). For example, ( y = 2x + 5 ) is parallel to ( y = 2x + 3 ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>Linear equations like ( y = 2x + 3 ) are widely used in various fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economics:</strong> They can represent cost functions or demand curves where ( x ) could be the quantity of goods and ( y ) the total cost or revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Physics:</strong> They can describe motion with constant velocity, where ( x ) is time and ( y ) is distance.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> They are used in modeling relationships between variables, such as the relationship between force and acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solving for ( x ) or ( y )</h3>
<p>To solve for ( x ) given a value of ( y ), you can rearrange the equation:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ( y = 7 ), then ( 7 = 2x + 3 ). Solving for ( x ):
[
7 - 3 = 2x \implies 4 = 2x \implies x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
]
So, when ( y = 7 ), ( x = 2 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve for ( y ) given a value of ( x ), you simply substitute ( x ) into the equation:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ( x = 4 ), then ( y = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ). So, when ( x = 4 ), ( y = 11 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the linear equation ( y = 2x + 3 ) is a fundamental representation of a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3, providing a clear and constant relationship between the variables ( x ) and ( y ).</p>
