## Linear Equation: \( y = 2x + 3 \)

### Equation Representation

A linear equation in the form \( y = mx + b \) represents a straight line on a Cartesian plane. In this specific equation, \( y = 2x + 3 \):

- **\( m \) (slope):** The coefficient of \( x \), which is 2, indicates the slope of the line. The slope describes how steep the line is and in which direction it is going. A positive slope of 2 means that for every unit increase in \( x \), \( y \) increases by 2 units.
- **\( b \) (y-intercept):** The constant term, which is 3, represents the y-intercept. This is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, specifically at the point \((0, 3)\).

### Graphical Interpretation

When graphing \( y = 2x + 3 \):

- **Starting Point:** The line starts at the y-intercept, which is at \( y = 3 \) when \( x = 0 \).
- **Direction and Steepness:** The line will move upwards to the right because the slope is positive. The steepness is determined by the slope of 2, meaning the line will rise 2 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right.
- **Example Points:** To plot additional points, you can choose values of \( x \) and calculate \( y \):
  - If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \). So, another point on the line is \((1, 5)\).
  - If \( x = -1 \), then \( y = 2(-1) + 3 = 1 \). So, another point on the line is \((-1, 1)\).

### Mathematical Properties

- **Linearity:** The equation is linear because the highest power of \( x \) is 1. This means the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) is constant and does not change as \( x \) changes.
- **Infinite Solutions:** A linear equation like \( y = 2x + 3 \) has an infinite number of solutions, each corresponding to a point on the line.
- **Parallel Lines:** If another line has the same slope (2) but a different y-intercept, it will be parallel to \( y = 2x + 3 \). For example, \( y = 2x + 5 \) is parallel to \( y = 2x + 3 \).

### Applications

Linear equations like \( y = 2x + 3 \) are widely used in various fields:

- **Economics:** They can represent cost functions or demand curves where \( x \) could be the quantity of goods and \( y \) the total cost or revenue.
- **Physics:** They can describe motion with constant velocity, where \( x \) is time and \( y \) is distance.
- **Engineering:** They are used in modeling relationships between variables, such as the relationship between force and acceleration.

### Solving for \( x \) or \( y \)

To solve for \( x \) given a value of \( y \), you can rearrange the equation:

- If \( y = 7 \), then \( 7 = 2x + 3 \). Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  7 - 3 = 2x \implies 4 = 2x \implies x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
  \]
  So, when \( y = 7 \), \( x = 2 \).

To solve for \( y \) given a value of \( x \), you simply substitute \( x \) into the equation:

- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \). So, when \( x = 4 \), \( y = 11 \).

In summary, the linear equation \( y = 2x + 3 \) is a fundamental representation of a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3, providing a clear and constant relationship between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).
