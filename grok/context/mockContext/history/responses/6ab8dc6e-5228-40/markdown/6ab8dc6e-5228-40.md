Here are two simple math equations:

1. **Linear Equation:**
   \[
   y = 2x + 3
   \]
   This equation represents a straight line where \(y\) is the dependent variable, \(x\) is the independent variable, with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3.

2. **Quadratic Equation:**
   \[
   y = x^2 - 4x + 4
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation, which can be represented as a parabola. The equation can be factored as \(y = (x-2)^2\), showing that the vertex of the parabola is at \(x = 2\).
