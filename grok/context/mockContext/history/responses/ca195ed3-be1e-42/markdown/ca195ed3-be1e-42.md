# Error Analysis: Invalid Path Argument

The error message you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with the type of the argument being passed to a function that expects a path. Specifically, the error states:

```
Error accessing path ./shell_helpers: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received an instance of Object
```

This error occurs because the `path` argument provided to the `join` function from the `node:path` module is not a string as expected, but instead, it is an object.

## What Happened?

1. **Function Call**: The error is occurring in the `ProfileFileLoader.loadFileContent` function, which is called from `createApiRequest` in `grok.js`.
2. **Incorrect Argument Type**: The `path.join` function is being called with an argument that is an instance of `Object` instead of a `string`.
3. **Expected Behavior**: The `path.join` function expects all its arguments to be strings, which it then concatenates into a path.

## How to Fix

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the path being passed to `path.join` is a string. Here are steps you can take:

1. **Check the Data Source**: Verify where the path value is coming from. Make sure it's not accidentally being wrapped in an object or incorrectly formatted.
2. **Convert to String**: If the path is stored in an object, you may need to extract the string value before passing it to `path.join`. For example, if the path is in an object like `obj.path`, use `obj.path.toString()` or `String(obj.path)`.
3. **Debugging**: Add console logs or use a debugger to inspect the value of the path argument right before it's passed to `path.join`.

Here's an example of how you might fix the code:

```javascript
// Before
const filePath = path.join(someObject);

// After
const filePath = path.join(String(someObject.path));
```

Make sure to adjust the code according to your actual data structure and requirements.
