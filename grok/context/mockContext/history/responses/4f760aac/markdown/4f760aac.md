To build a Docker image on Windows, you typically use the Docker command line interface in a Command Prompt or PowerShell window. Here are the steps and the command you would use:

### Steps to Build a Docker Image on Windows

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**: Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running on your Windows machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the Command Prompt or PowerShell to navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile.

   ```powershell
   cd path\to\your\directory
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the `docker build` command to build your image. The basic syntax is as follows:

   ```powershell
   docker build -t your-image-name:tag .
   ```

   - Replace `your-image-name` with the name you want to give your image.
   - Replace `tag` with a tag for your image (e.g., `latest`, `v1`, etc.).
   - The `.` at the end of the command tells Docker to use the current directory as the build context.

### Example

If you have a Dockerfile in a directory called `my-app`, and you want to build an image named `my-app-image` with the tag `v1`, you would do the following:

```powershell
cd my-app
docker build -t my-app-image:v1 .
```

This command will read the instructions from your Dockerfile and build the Docker image accordingly.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your Dockerfile is correctly formatted and in the correct location.
- If you encounter any issues, check the Docker Desktop logs or use the `docker build` command with the `--no-cache` flag to rebuild the image without using the cache.
