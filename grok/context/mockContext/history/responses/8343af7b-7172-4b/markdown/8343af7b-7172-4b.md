# Deploying a Solana Token

To deploy a Solana token quickly, you can use the Solana CLI tools along with a simple script. Below is an example of how to create and deploy a basic SPL (Solana Program Library) token.

## Prerequisites
- Solana CLI installed and configured
- A Solana wallet with some SOL for transaction fees

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a new keypair for the token:**
   ```bash
   solana-keygen new -o token.json
   ```

2. **Create the token:**
   ```bash
   spl-token create-token token.json
   ```
   This command will output the token address.

3. **Create an account to hold the token:**
   ```bash
   spl-token create-account <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
   ```
   Replace `<TOKEN_ADDRESS>` with the address from the previous step.

4. **Mint tokens to the account:**
   ```bash
   spl-token mint <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>
   ```
   Replace `<TOKEN_ADDRESS>` with your token's address and `<AMOUNT>` with the number of tokens you want to mint.

5. **Check your token account balance:**
   ```bash
   spl-token balance <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
   ```

## Example Script

Here's a simple script to automate the process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a new keypair for the token
solana-keygen new -o token.json

# Create the token
TOKEN_ADDRESS=$(spl-token create-token token.json)

# Create an account to hold the token
spl-token create-account $TOKEN_ADDRESS

# Mint 1000 tokens to the account
spl-token mint $TOKEN_ADDRESS 1000

# Check the balance
spl-token balance $TOKEN_ADDRESS
```

Make sure to run this script in an environment where you have the Solana CLI tools installed and configured.

This script provides a quick way to deploy a Solana token, but remember to handle your keys securely and understand the implications of token creation and distribution.
