To set up the KaTeX extension with marked for parsing READMEs, you need to configure both marked and KaTeX appropriately. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up, including the suggested KaTeX options to use with marked:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have both `marked` and `katex` installed in your project:

```bash
npm install marked katex
```

### Step 2: Configure Marked with KaTeX

To use KaTeX with marked, you need to create a custom renderer for marked that will handle LaTeX expressions and render them using KaTeX. Below is an example of how to set this up:

```javascript
const marked = require('marked');
const katex = require('katex');

// Define a custom renderer
const renderer = new marked.Renderer();

// Custom function to handle inline LaTeX
renderer.inlineText = function(text) {
    return text.replace(/\$\$(.+?)\$\$/g, (match, p1) => {
        try {
            return katex.renderToString(p1, {
                throwOnError: false,
                displayMode: false,
            });
        } catch (error) {
            return match;
        }
    }).replace(/\$(.+?)\$/g, (match, p1) => {
        try {
            return katex.renderToString(p1, {
                throwOnError: false,
                displayMode: true,
            });
        } catch (error) {
            return match;
        }
    });
};

// Configure marked with the custom renderer
marked.setOptions({
    renderer: renderer,
    gfm: true,
    tables: true,
    breaks: false,
    pedantic: false,
    sanitize: false,
    smartLists: true,
    smartypants: false,
    xhtml: false
});

// Example usage
const markdownText = 'Here is an inline equation: $E=mc^2$ and a displayed equation: $$E=mc^2$$';
const html = marked(markdownText);
console.log(html);
```

### Suggested KaTeX Options

When using KaTeX with marked, the following options are suggested:

- **throwOnError**: Set to `false` to prevent the renderer from crashing if there's an error in the LaTeX code. Instead, it will display the original LaTeX code.
- **displayMode**: Set to `true` for block equations ($$...$$) and `false` for inline equations ($...$).

These options ensure that your LaTeX equations are rendered correctly within your Markdown text.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your parser is not working out of the box, check the following:

- **LaTeX Syntax**: Ensure your LaTeX syntax is correct. KaTeX is quite strict about syntax.
- **Escaping Characters**: Make sure you're escaping any special Markdown characters that might interfere with LaTeX.
- **Version Compatibility**: Check that the versions of `marked` and `katex` you're using are compatible.

By following these steps and using the suggested options, you should be able to successfully set up KaTeX with marked for parsing READMEs containing LaTeX equations.
