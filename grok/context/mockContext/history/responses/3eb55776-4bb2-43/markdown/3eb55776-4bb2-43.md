Here are two types of mathematical equations for you:

### Linear Equation
A linear equation in two variables can be written in the form:
\[ ax + by = c \]
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) and \(y\) are variables. An example of a linear equation is:
\[ 2x + 3y = 6 \]

### Quadratic Equation
A quadratic equation is an equation of the second degree, typically written in the form:
\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) is the variable. An example of a quadratic equation is:
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]
