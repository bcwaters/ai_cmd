### Linear Equation

A linear equation in two variables is a fundamental concept in algebra, expressed in the standard form:

\[ ax + by = c \]

Here, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) and \(y\) are variables. This form represents a straight line on the Cartesian plane.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Linearity**: The equation is linear because the variables \(x\) and \(y\) are raised to the first power. There are no products of variables, nor are there any variables raised to any power other than one.
- **Slope-Intercept Form**: Linear equations can also be written in the slope-intercept form, which is:
  \[ y = mx + b \]
  where \(m\) represents the slope of the line, and \(b\) represents the y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
- **Graphical Representation**: When graphed, a linear equation results in a straight line. The slope \(m\) determines the steepness and direction of the line, while the y-intercept \(b\) determines where the line intersects the y-axis.
- **Solving for Variables**: To solve for one variable in terms of the other, you can rearrange the equation. For example, solving for \(y\) in the standard form \(ax + by = c\) involves isolating \(y\):
  \[ by = -ax + c \]
  \[ y = -\frac{a}{b}x + \frac{c}{b} \]
  This transformation converts the equation into the slope-intercept form, where \(-\frac{a}{b}\) is the slope and \(\frac{c}{b}\) is the y-intercept.

#### Example:

Consider the linear equation:

\[ 2x + 3y = 6 \]

To convert this into slope-intercept form, solve for \(y\):

\[ 3y = -2x + 6 \]
\[ y = -\frac{2}{3}x + 2 \]

In this form, the slope \(m\) is \(-\frac{2}{3}\) and the y-intercept \(b\) is 2.

#### Applications:

- **Economics**: Linear equations are used to model supply and demand curves, cost functions, and revenue functions.
- **Physics**: They describe relationships between variables such as distance, time, and velocity in uniformly accelerated motion.
- **Engineering**: Linear equations help in designing and analyzing systems, such as electrical circuits and structural beams.

Understanding linear equations is crucial for solving systems of equations, which are used in many fields to model and solve real-world problems.
