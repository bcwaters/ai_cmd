```javascript
const debounce = (func, delay) => {
  let timeoutId;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
};
```

This example demonstrates a `debounce` function, which is useful for optimizing performance by limiting the rate at which a function can fire. It's particularly useful in scenarios like handling resize events or search input where you want to wait until the user has stopped interacting before executing a function.
