Here's a mix of LaTeX code blocks and inline LaTeX for theoretical computer science information:

### Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or space requirements relative to the input size. Here's how some common complexities are represented in LaTeX:

```latex
\begin{align*}
O(n) & \text{ represents linear time complexity} \\
O(n^2) & \text{ represents quadratic time complexity} \\
O(\log n) & \text{ represents logarithmic time complexity} \\
O(n \log n) & \text{ represents linearithmic time complexity}
\end{align*}
```

### Turing Machines

A Turing machine is a theoretical computing machine that serves as a model for modern computers. The transition function of a Turing machine can be represented as:

```latex
\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}
```

where $Q$ is the set of states, $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, and $L$ and $R$ represent left and right movement of the read/write head.

### P vs NP Problem

The P vs NP problem is one of the most important open problems in theoretical computer science. It can be stated as:

Is $P = NP$? Where $P$ is the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time, and $NP$ is the set of decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.

In LaTeX, this can be written inline as: $P \stackrel{?}{=} NP$.

### Complexity Classes

Complexity classes are sets of problems grouped by their resource requirements. Some common complexity classes include:

- $P$: Problems solvable in polynomial time
- $NP$: Problems verifiable in polynomial time
- $PSPACE$: Problems solvable in polynomial space
- $EXPTIME$: Problems solvable in exponential time

These can be represented in a LaTeX code block as:

```latex
\begin{align*}
P & = \{ L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k \} \\
NP & = \{ L \mid \exists \text{ a nondeterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k \} \\
PSPACE & = \{ L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ uses space } O(n^k) \text{ for some } k \} \\
EXPTIME & = \{ L \mid \exists \text{ a deterministic TM } M \text{ such that } L(M) = L \text{ and } M \text{ runs in time } O(2^{n^k}) \text{ for some } k \}
\end{align*}
```

This mix of inline and code block LaTeX should give you a good overview of how theoretical computer science concepts can be represented using mathematical notation.
