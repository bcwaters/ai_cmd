# Lesson Plan for 8th Grade Trigonometry

## Objective:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand and apply basic trigonometric functions to solve right triangles.

## Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Trigonometric tables
- Calculators
- Worksheets on trigonometry problems

## Introduction (10 minutes):
- Begin with a brief discussion on why trigonometry is important in real life (e.g., architecture, engineering, navigation).
- Introduce the basic trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent, defined as:
  - $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
  - $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
  - $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$

## Direct Instruction (20 minutes):
- Use the whiteboard to illustrate a right triangle and label its sides.
- Demonstrate how to calculate $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$ of an angle using example problems.
- Explain the use of trigonometric tables and calculators for finding these values.

## Guided Practice (15 minutes):
- Hand out worksheets with various right triangles.
- Students work in pairs to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of given angles.
- Walk around to assist and ensure understanding.

## Independent Practice (20 minutes):
- Provide a set of problems where students must solve for missing sides or angles using trigonometric functions.
- Encourage the use of calculators and trigonometric tables.

## Closure (5 minutes):
- Review key points about the trigonometric functions.
- Ask students to share one thing they learned or found interesting about trigonometry.

## Assessment:
- Collect and review the worksheets to assess students' understanding of trigonometric concepts.
- A short quiz at the end of the unit to test retention.

## Extension:
- For advanced students, introduce the inverse trigonometric functions and how to solve more complex problems.

## Follow-up Questions:
- What other real-world applications of trigonometry can you think of?
- How do you think you might use trigonometry in future studies or careers?
- Can you explain the difference between sine, cosine, and tangent to someone who has never heard of them?
