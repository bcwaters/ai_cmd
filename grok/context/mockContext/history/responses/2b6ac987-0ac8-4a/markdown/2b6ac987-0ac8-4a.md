# Testing Audio Levels

To ensure your audio setup is functioning correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Microphone Check**: Speak into your microphone and check if the audio levels are registering correctly. You can use software like Audacity or your system's sound settings to monitor the input levels.

2. **Adjusting Settings**: If the audio levels are too low or too high, adjust your microphone sensitivity or gain. Most operating systems allow you to do this through the sound settings.

3. **Quality Check**: Listen to a recording to ensure the audio quality meets your needs. Adjust settings if necessary.

4. **Testing Environment**: Make sure to test in the environment where you will be using the audio to account for background noise.

Remember, clear audio communication is crucial for effective interaction.
