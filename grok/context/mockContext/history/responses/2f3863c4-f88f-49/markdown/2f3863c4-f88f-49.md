Here's a code block with a declared language to test your syntax highlighter:

```python
# This is a simple Python function to test syntax highlighting
def greet(name):
    """
    A function that greets the person passed in as a parameter
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

If your syntax highlighter is working correctly, you should see the Python keywords, strings, and comments highlighted appropriately.
