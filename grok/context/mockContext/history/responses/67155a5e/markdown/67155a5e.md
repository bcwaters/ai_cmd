Yes, there are several Docker images that come preinstalled with Node.js and npm. Here are some popular options:

### Official Node.js Images

The official Node.js images on Docker Hub are a reliable choice. They come in various flavors, depending on your needs:

1. **Node.js LTS (Long Term Support)**
   - **Image:** `node:lts`
   - **Description:** This image uses the latest LTS version of Node.js, which is recommended for most users due to its stability and long-term support.

2. **Latest Node.js Version**
   - **Image:** `node:latest`
   - **Description:** This image contains the most recent version of Node.js, which might be suitable if you need the latest features but be aware that it might not be as stable as the LTS version.

3. **Alpine Variants**
   - **Image:** `node:lts-alpine` or `node:latest-alpine`
   - **Description:** These images are based on Alpine Linux, which results in smaller image sizes. They are ideal if you want to minimize the footprint of your Docker image.

### Example Usage

To use any of these images, you can pull and run them directly:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull node:lts

# Run a container from the image
docker run -it node:lts /bin/bash
```

Inside the container, you can verify the Node.js and npm versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Additional Notes

- **Customization:** If you need additional software or specific configurations, you can create your own Dockerfile based on these images.
- **Documentation:** For detailed information on these images, visit the [official Node.js Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/node).

These images are widely used and well-maintained, making them a good starting point for Node.js-based applications in Docker.
