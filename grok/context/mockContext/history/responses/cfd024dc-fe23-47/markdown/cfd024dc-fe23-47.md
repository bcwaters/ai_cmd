# What is tRPC?

tRPC is a TypeScript-based remote procedure call (RPC) framework designed to simplify the process of building and consuming APIs. It is primarily used for creating type-safe APIs that can be easily integrated into full-stack TypeScript applications. Here's a brief overview of tRPC:

- **Type Safety**: tRPC leverages TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety across the client and server, reducing runtime errors.
- **Simplified API Development**: It abstracts away much of the complexity involved in setting up and managing API endpoints, allowing developers to focus on business logic.
- **Integration**: tRPC is particularly well-suited for use with Next.js and other modern web frameworks, enhancing the development experience by integrating seamlessly with existing TypeScript ecosystems.
- **Performance**: By using WebSocket or HTTP, tRPC can provide real-time communication and efficient data transfer between client and server.

For a basic example of how tRPC might be used in a project, consider the following:

```typescript
// server.ts
import * as trpc from '@trpc/server';
import { z } from 'zod';

const appRouter = trpc.router().query('hello', {
  input: z.string().nullish(),
  resolve({ input }) {
    return `Hello ${input ?? 'World'}`;
  },
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;

// client.ts
import { createTRPCProxyClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';
import type { AppRouter } from './server';

const client = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [httpBatchLink({ url: 'http://localhost:3000/trpc' })],
});

async function main() {
  const result = await client.hello.query('Alice');
  console.log(result); // Output: Hello Alice
}

main();
```

This example demonstrates a simple query setup with tRPC, showing how to define a server endpoint and consume it from a client.
