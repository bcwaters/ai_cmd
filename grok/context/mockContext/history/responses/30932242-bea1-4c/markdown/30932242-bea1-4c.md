Here are two TensorFlow.js models suitable for fine-tuning to recognize AI-generated images:

1. **MobileNet**
   - Lightweight and efficient, ideal for mobile and edge devices.
   - Can be fine-tuned for AI-generated image detection.

2. **EfficientNet**
   - Developed by Google, offering state-of-the-art accuracy with efficiency.
   - Suitable for fine-tuning to detect AI-generated images.

Both models can be loaded and used in TensorFlow.js for AI image classification tasks.
