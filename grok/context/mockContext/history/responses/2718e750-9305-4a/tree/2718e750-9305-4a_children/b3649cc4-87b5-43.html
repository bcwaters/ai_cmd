<h1>Automatic SSL Certificates in Coolify</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Coolify's automatic SSL certificate feature is designed to simplify the process of securing your applications with HTTPS. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the security and trust of your users.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Coolify integrates with Let's Encrypt, a free, automated, and open certificate authority, to issue and manage SSL certificates. Here's a detailed look at how this process works:</p>
<h3>Certificate Issuance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Verification</strong>: When you deploy an application, Coolify automatically initiates a domain verification process with Let's Encrypt. This typically involves setting up a temporary HTTP challenge on your server.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Request</strong>: Once the domain is verified, Coolify requests a certificate from Let's Encrypt. This certificate is then associated with your application's domain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduled Checks</strong>: Coolify schedules regular checks to monitor the expiration dates of your SSL certificates. Typically, certificates are renewed 30 days before they expire.</li>
<li><strong>Renewal Process</strong>: If a certificate is nearing its expiration, Coolify automatically initiates a renewal request. This process is seamless and requires no manual intervention from the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nginx Integration</strong>: Coolify uses Nginx as its web server. When a certificate is issued or renewed, Coolify updates the Nginx configuration to use the new certificate, ensuring that your application remains accessible over HTTPS without interruption.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Storage</strong>: The certificates are stored securely on your server, and Coolify manages their lifecycle, including backups and updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Automatic SSL certificates ensure that your applications are always served over a secure connection, protecting data in transit.</li>
<li><strong>User Trust</strong>: HTTPS is a standard expectation for modern web applications, and automatic SSL certificates help maintain user trust by ensuring your site's security.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: By automating the entire process, Coolify removes the complexity of managing SSL certificates, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying your applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed Renewals</strong>: If a renewal fails, Coolify will notify you via the dashboard. Common issues include domain validation failures or server misconfigurations. Coolify provides detailed logs to help diagnose and resolve these issues.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Intervention</strong>: In rare cases, manual intervention might be required. Coolify allows you to manually trigger a certificate renewal or update the certificate settings if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong>: Let's Encrypt has rate limits on certificate issuance and renewals. Coolify manages these limits internally to ensure compliance, but heavy usage might require additional considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard Certificates</strong>: Coolify also supports wildcard certificates, which can be useful for managing multiple subdomains under a single certificate.</li>
</ul>
