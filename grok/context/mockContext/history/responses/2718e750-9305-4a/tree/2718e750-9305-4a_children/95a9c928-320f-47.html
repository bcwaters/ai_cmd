<h3>Unified Management Interface</h3>
<p>Coolify's Unified Management Interface is designed to streamline the management of multiple applications on a single server. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key components and functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralized Dashboard</strong>: The dashboard serves as the nerve center for all your applications. It provides a comprehensive overview of all running services, including their status, resource usage, and logs. This centralized view eliminates the need to log into multiple platforms or servers, saving time and reducing the potential for errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Source Integration</strong>: Coolify supports integration with various application sources such as Docker, GitHub, GitLab, and more. This means you can deploy applications directly from your version control systems or container registries without needing to manually configure each service. The interface allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull and Deploy</strong>: Automatically pull the latest code or container images from your repositories and deploy them with a few clicks.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and Update</strong>: Keep track of the status of your deployments and easily update or rollback to previous versions if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User-Friendly Navigation</strong>: The interface is designed with usability in mind. It features intuitive navigation menus and clear, actionable buttons for common tasks like starting, stopping, or restarting applications. This user-friendly design ensures that even users with limited technical expertise can manage their applications effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-Time Monitoring</strong>: The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of your applications. You can view CPU, memory, and disk usage, as well as network traffic, all in real-time. This feature helps in quickly identifying and resolving performance issues before they impact your users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customizable Views</strong>: Users can customize their dashboard to focus on the metrics and applications that matter most to them. You can set up custom alerts and notifications for specific events or thresholds, ensuring you're always informed about the health of your applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and Access Control</strong>: The management interface includes robust security features. You can set up user roles and permissions to control who can access and manage different parts of your server. This ensures that sensitive operations are only performed by authorized personnel.</p>
