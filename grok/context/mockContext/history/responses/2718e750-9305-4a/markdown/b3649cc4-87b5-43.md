# Automatic SSL Certificates in Coolify

## Overview
Coolify's automatic SSL certificate feature is designed to simplify the process of securing your applications with HTTPS. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the security and trust of your users.

## How It Works
Coolify integrates with Let's Encrypt, a free, automated, and open certificate authority, to issue and manage SSL certificates. Here's a detailed look at how this process works:

### Certificate Issuance
- **Domain Verification**: When you deploy an application, Coolify automatically initiates a domain verification process with Let's Encrypt. This typically involves setting up a temporary HTTP challenge on your server.
- **Certificate Request**: Once the domain is verified, Coolify requests a certificate from Let's Encrypt. This certificate is then associated with your application's domain.

### Automatic Renewal
- **Scheduled Checks**: Coolify schedules regular checks to monitor the expiration dates of your SSL certificates. Typically, certificates are renewed 30 days before they expire.
- **Renewal Process**: If a certificate is nearing its expiration, Coolify automatically initiates a renewal request. This process is seamless and requires no manual intervention from the user.

### Configuration
- **Nginx Integration**: Coolify uses Nginx as its web server. When a certificate is issued or renewed, Coolify updates the Nginx configuration to use the new certificate, ensuring that your application remains accessible over HTTPS without interruption.
- **Certificate Storage**: The certificates are stored securely on your server, and Coolify manages their lifecycle, including backups and updates.

## Benefits
- **Security**: Automatic SSL certificates ensure that your applications are always served over a secure connection, protecting data in transit.
- **User Trust**: HTTPS is a standard expectation for modern web applications, and automatic SSL certificates help maintain user trust by ensuring your site's security.
- **Ease of Use**: By automating the entire process, Coolify removes the complexity of managing SSL certificates, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying your applications.

## Troubleshooting
- **Failed Renewals**: If a renewal fails, Coolify will notify you via the dashboard. Common issues include domain validation failures or server misconfigurations. Coolify provides detailed logs to help diagnose and resolve these issues.
- **Manual Intervention**: In rare cases, manual intervention might be required. Coolify allows you to manually trigger a certificate renewal or update the certificate settings if needed.

## Additional Considerations
- **Rate Limits**: Let's Encrypt has rate limits on certificate issuance and renewals. Coolify manages these limits internally to ensure compliance, but heavy usage might require additional considerations.
- **Wildcard Certificates**: Coolify also supports wildcard certificates, which can be useful for managing multiple subdomains under a single certificate.
