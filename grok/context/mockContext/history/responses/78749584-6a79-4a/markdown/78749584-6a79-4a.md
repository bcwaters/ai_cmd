Here is a list of LaTeX equations, some presented in code blocks and others inline:

### Inline LaTeX Equations:

- The quadratic formula is given by \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), and its solution is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
- Einstein's mass-energy equivalence is expressed as \( E = mc^2 \).

### LaTeX Equations in Code Blocks:
