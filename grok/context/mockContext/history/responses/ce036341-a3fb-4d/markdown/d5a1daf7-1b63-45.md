### Jupiter

**Summary**: Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system, is a gas giant with a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers). It's composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun. Jupiter's thick atmosphere hosts a variety of weather phenomena, most notably the Great Red Spot, a storm that has been ongoing for at least 300 years.

**Atmosphere and Weather**: The atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into several layers, with the visible clouds being the topmost layer. These clouds are composed of ammonia crystals and are arranged in bands of different colors, ranging from white to orange to brown. The Great Red Spot is a high-pressure region whose reddish color is likely due to complex organic molecules, phosphine, and sulfur compounds. Besides the Great Red Spot, Jupiter experiences other smaller storms and vortices, with wind speeds reaching up to 220 mph (354 km/h).

**Magnetic Field**: Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field traps charged particles, creating intense radiation belts around the planet, which can be harmful to spacecraft.

**Composition**: Beneath the atmosphere, Jupiter's interior is thought to consist of a dense core of rocky material, surrounded by a thick layer of metallic hydrogen. This metallic hydrogen is created by the immense pressure inside Jupiter, causing the hydrogen to behave like a metal, which contributes to the planet's strong magnetic field.

**Moons**: Jupiter has 79 known moons, the four largest of which are known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Each of these moons is unique; Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, Europa has a subsurface ocean that could potentially harbor life, Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and has its own magnetic field, and Callisto is covered with impact craters and has an ancient, icy surface.

**Exploration**: Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s, the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s, and most recently, the Juno spacecraft, which is currently orbiting Jupiter and providing detailed data about its atmosphere and magnetic field.
