To refactor `writeHtml.js` and ensure that the `main()` function and all its dependencies are properly imported and available, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Organize Your Code

First, organize your `writeHtml.js` to clearly separate the `main()` function and any helper functions or dependencies. You might want to consider splitting the helper functions and dependencies into their own modules if they are not already.

### Step 2: Exporting from `writeHtml.js`

Make sure that `writeHtml.js` exports the `main()` function and any other necessary functions or objects. Here's how you might structure `writeHtml.js`:

```javascript
// writeHtml.js

// Import any dependencies needed within this file
const utilClass1 = require('./utilClass1');
const utilClass2 = require('./utilClass2');

// Helper functions
function helperFunction1() {
  // Implementation
}

function helperFunction2() {
  // Implementation
}

// Main function
function main() {
  // Use helper functions and util classes
  helperFunction1();
  utilClass1.someMethod();
  utilClass2.anotherMethod();
}

// Export the main function and any helper functions if needed
module.exports = {
  main,
  helperFunction1,
  helperFunction2
};
```

### Step 3: Importing in the Express Server

In your Express server file, you can import the `main()` function along with any other required functions or objects. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```javascript
// server.js

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Import the main function from writeHtml.js
const { main } = require('./writeHtml');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Call the main function from writeHtml.js
  main();

  // Send a response to the client
  res.send('HTML file has been written');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Step 4: Ensuring Dependencies are Available

Ensure that all the dependencies used in `writeHtml.js` are properly imported within that file or within the helper functions it calls. If the dependencies are in separate files, make sure those files are correctly exported and imported as shown in the example above.

### Additional Tips

- **Modularize**: If `writeHtml.js` is getting too large, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable modules. Each module can export specific functions that can be imported as needed.
- **Testing**: After refactoring, make sure to test your application to ensure that all functionalities still work as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to refactor `writeHtml.js`, properly import the `main()` function, and ensure all dependencies are available for use in your Express server.
