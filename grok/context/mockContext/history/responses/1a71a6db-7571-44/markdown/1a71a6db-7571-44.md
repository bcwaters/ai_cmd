# What is a Symlink?

A symlink, or symbolic link, is a type of file that serves as a reference or pointer to another file or directory. It is similar to a shortcut on Windows or an alias on macOS. Symlinks are used in Unix-like operating systems to create a flexible way to manage files and directories.

- **Creation**: Symlinks can be created using the `ln -s` command in Unix-like systems. For example, `ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/symlink` creates a symlink at `/path/to/symlink` that points to `/path/to/original`.
- **Usage**: When you access a symlink, you are actually accessing the file or directory it points to. This can be useful for organizing files or maintaining compatibility between different parts of a system.
- **Types**: There are two types of links in Unix systems: hard links and symbolic links. Hard links are direct pointers to the data on the disk, while symbolic links are more like shortcuts, pointing to the file name.
