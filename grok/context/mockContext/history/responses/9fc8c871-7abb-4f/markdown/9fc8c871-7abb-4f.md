# Testing in Markdown

Testing is an essential part of software development. Here's a brief overview of how to approach testing:

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual units or components of your software.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between integrated units.
- **System Testing**: Test the complete and integrated software product.

For more detailed information, consider the following resources:
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) for Java unit testing.
- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for Python testing.
