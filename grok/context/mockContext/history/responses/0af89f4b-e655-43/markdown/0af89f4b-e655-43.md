**Introduction (10 minutes):**
1. **Warm-up Activity:** Begin with a quick review of basic geometric concepts related to triangles. Ask students to solve simple problems involving the Pythagorean theorem.
2. **Introduction to Trigonometry:** Introduce the concept of trigonometry, explaining its importance in solving problems involving right triangles. Define sine, cosine, and tangent using the mnemonic SOH-CAH-TOA.

**Direct Instruction (20 minutes):**
1. **Understanding Trigonometric Ratios:** Explain how to find sine, cosine, and tangent using the sides of a right triangle. Demonstrate with a right triangle model.
2. **Example Problems:** Work through several example problems on the board, showing how to use trigonometry to find missing sides or angles in right triangles.

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**
1. **Worksheet Activity:** Distribute worksheets with trigonometry problems for students to solve. Walk around the classroom to provide assistance and check for understanding.
2. **Group Work:** Encourage students to work in pairs to solve the problems and discuss their solutions.

**Independent Practice (10 minutes):**
1. **Individual Work:** Assign a few more problems for students to solve on their own. This will reinforce their understanding and allow them to practice independently.
2. **Review:** Collect the worksheets and quickly review a few answers to ensure all students understand the concept.

**Closure (5 minutes):**
1. **Summary:** Recap the key points of the lesson, emphasizing the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent and how to use them.
2. **Exit Ticket:** Ask students to write down one thing they learned about trigonometry and one question they still have.

**Assessment:**  
- **Formative Assessment:** Monitor student participation and understanding during the guided and independent practice.
- **Summative Assessment:** Use the exit tickets to gauge student learning and identify any areas needing further clarification.

**Extension Activities:**  
For advanced students, introduce the unit circle and discuss how trigonometric functions can be extended to all angles.
