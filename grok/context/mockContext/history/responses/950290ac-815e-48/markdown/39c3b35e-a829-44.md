# Detailed Example of Using ASTs in Python

In this section, we'll delve deeper into the example of using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in Python. The example provided earlier was a simple demonstration of parsing code and traversing the AST to identify functions and variables. Let's expand on this by adding more functionality and providing a more comprehensive understanding of how ASTs can be used in Python.

## Parsing Code into an AST

The first step in working with ASTs is to parse the source code into a tree structure. The `ast` module in Python provides the `parse` function for this purpose. Here's how it works:

```python
import ast

# Sample code to parse
code = """
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    return f"Nice to meet you, {name}!"

def add(a, b):
    return a + b
"""

# Parse the code into an AST
tree = ast.parse(code)
```

This code snippet parses a string containing Python code into an AST. The `tree` variable now holds the root of the AST, which can be further analyzed.

## Traversing the AST

Once the AST is created, you can traverse it to analyze its structure. The `ast.walk` function allows you to iterate over all nodes in the tree:

```python
# Traverse the AST
for node in ast.walk(tree):
    if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
        print(f"Found function: {node.name}")
        # Print function arguments
        for arg in node.args.args:
            print(f"  Argument: {arg.arg}")
    elif isinstance(node, ast.Name):
        print(f"Found variable: {node.id}")
    elif isinstance(node, ast.Return):
        print(f"Found return statement")
        # Check if the return value is a string
        if isinstance(node.value, ast.Constant) and isinstance(node.value.value, str):
            print(f"  Returning a string: {node.value.value}")
```

This code traverses the AST and identifies functions, their arguments, variables, and return statements. It also checks if the return value is a string, demonstrating how you can inspect the content of nodes.

## Modifying the AST

ASTs can be modified to transform the code. Here's an example of how to add a new function to the existing AST:

```python
# Create a new function node
new_function = ast.FunctionDef(
    name='multiply',
    args=ast.arguments(
        args=[ast.arg(arg='x'), ast.arg(arg='y')],
        vararg=None,
        kwonlyargs=[],
        kw_defaults=[],
        kwarg=None,
        defaults=[]
    ),
    body=[
        ast.Return(value=ast.BinOp(
            left=ast.Name(id='x', ctx=ast.Load()),
            op=ast.Mult(),
            right=ast.Name(id='y', ctx=ast.Load())
        ))
    ],
    decorator_list=[],
    returns=None
)

# Add the new function to the AST
tree.body.append(new_function)

# Print the modified AST
print(ast.unparse(tree))
```

This code creates a new function `multiply` and adds it to the existing AST. The `ast.unparse` function is then used to convert the AST back into Python code, which will now include the new function.

## Generating New Code

After modifying the AST, you can generate new code from it. Here's how you can use the modified AST to create a new Python file:

```python
# Generate new code from the modified AST
new_code = ast.unparse(tree)

# Write the new code to a file
with open('modified_code.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write(new_code)
```

This code writes the modified AST back to a new Python file, demonstrating how ASTs can be used to generate code.

## Conclusion

This detailed example showcases how ASTs can be used in Python to parse, traverse, modify, and generate code. By understanding and manipulating the AST, you can perform complex code analysis and transformations, making it a powerful tool in software development and text processing.
