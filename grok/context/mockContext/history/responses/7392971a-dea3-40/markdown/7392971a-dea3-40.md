Here are some common LaTeX equations rendered using Math format:

### Basic Algebra
- **Quadratic Equation**: 
  The standard form of a quadratic equation is given by:
  $$
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0
  $$
  where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants.

- **Pythagorean Theorem**:
  For a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is described by:
  $$
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  $$
  where \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.

### Calculus
- **Derivative of a Function**:
  The derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is denoted as:
  $$
  f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f(x)
  $$
  For example, the derivative of \(f(x) = x^2\) is:
  $$
  f'(x) = 2x
  $$

- **Integral of a Function**:
  The indefinite integral of a function \(f(x)\) is written as:
  $$
  \int f(x) \, dx
  $$
  For example, the integral of \(f(x) = x^2\) is:
  $$
  \int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
  $$
  where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

### Physics
- **Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence**:
  This famous equation from Einstein's theory of relativity states:
  $$
  E = mc^2
  $$
  where \(E\) is energy, \(m\) is mass, and \(c\) is the speed of light.

- **Newton's Second Law of Motion**:
  The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is given by:
  $$
  F = ma
  $$
  where \(F\) is the force applied, \(m\) is the mass of the object, and \(a\) is the acceleration.
