# Testing Audio Levels

To ensure the audio equipment is functioning correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Speak Clearly**: Say "testing one two three" into the microphone.
2. **Check Levels**: Monitor the audio levels on your recording device to ensure they are within the optimal range.
3. **Adjust if Necessary**: If the levels are too low or too high, adjust the microphone gain or distance from the microphone accordingly.

This simple test helps in setting up the audio for any recording or live session.
