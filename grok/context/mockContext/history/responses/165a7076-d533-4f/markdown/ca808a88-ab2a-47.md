# Hexagram 64: Wei Ji - Before Completion

Hexagram 64, known as "Wei Ji" or "Before Completion," is the final hexagram in the I Ching and symbolizes the state just before a significant change or the completion of a cycle. This hexagram represents the transitional phase where the old is fading away, and the new is about to emerge, but has not yet fully materialized.

## Symbolism and Interpretation

- **Transition and Preparation**: Wei Ji embodies the idea of being in a state of readiness and preparation for what is to come. It signifies that although the current situation is not yet complete, the groundwork is being laid for future developments.
- **Balance of Elements**: The hexagram consists of water above fire, symbolizing the delicate balance required to navigate through this transitional period. The water represents the potential for new beginnings, while the fire signifies the energy needed to push through to completion.
- **Caution and Vigilance**: This hexagram advises caution and vigilance. It suggests that while the end is near, it is crucial to remain attentive to details and potential pitfalls to ensure a successful transition.
- **Final Push**: Wei Ji encourages a final push towards completion. It indicates that the end is in sight, but effort and focus are still required to cross the finish line.

## Practical Application
