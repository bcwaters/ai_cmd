<h1>Hexagram 60: Jie - Limitation</h1>
<p>Hexagram 60 in the I Ching, known as "Jie" or "Limitation," delves into the concept of boundaries and self-discipline. This hexagram is symbolized by the image of water over lake, suggesting a natural boundary where water is contained yet flows freely within its limits.</p>
<h2>Key Themes of Hexagram 60</h2>
<h3>Restriction and Self-Discipline</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restriction</strong>: Jie emphasizes the importance of setting limits in life. Just as a lake has its boundaries to maintain its integrity, so too must individuals set boundaries to maintain order and harmony in their lives.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Discipline</strong>: The hexagram advocates for self-control and the ability to restrain oneself from excess. This self-discipline is not about harsh limitations but rather about understanding and respecting one's own capacities and limits.</li>
