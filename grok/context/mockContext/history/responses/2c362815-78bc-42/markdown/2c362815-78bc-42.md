To use `rehype-katex` for rendering fenced LaTeX code in Markdown, you need to integrate it into your Markdown processing pipeline. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Install the Necessary Packages

First, you need to install `rehype-katex` and its dependencies. You'll also need `remark-parse` to parse Markdown, `remark-rehype` to convert Markdown AST to HTML AST, and `rehype-stringify` to convert the HTML AST back to a string.

```bash
npm install rehype-katex remark-parse remark-rehype rehype-stringify
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Processing Pipeline

You'll need to create a pipeline that processes Markdown, converts it to HTML, and then uses `rehype-katex` to render LaTeX equations. Here's how you can set this up using JavaScript:

```javascript
const unified = require('unified');
const remarkParse = require('remark-parse');
const remarkRehype = require('remark-rehype');
const rehypeKatex = require('rehype-katex');
const rehypeStringify = require('rehype-stringify');

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse) // Parse Markdown
  .use(remarkRehype) // Convert Markdown AST to HTML AST
  .use(rehypeKatex) // Render LaTeX equations
  .use(rehypeStringify); // Convert HTML AST to string

// Example Markdown with fenced LaTeX code
const markdown = `
# Example

\`\`\`math
E = mc^2
\`\`\`
`;

// Process the Markdown
processor.process(markdown).then((file) => {
  console.log(String(file)); // Outputs the HTML with rendered LaTeX
});
```

### Step 3: Use Fenced Code Blocks for LaTeX

In your Markdown, use fenced code blocks with the `math` language specifier to indicate LaTeX code. For example:

```markdown
\`\`\`math
E = mc^2
\`\`\`
```

This will be processed by `rehype-katex` and rendered as a LaTeX equation in the output HTML.

### Step 4: Include KaTeX CSS

To ensure that the LaTeX equations are displayed correctly, you need to include the KaTeX CSS in your HTML. You can do this by adding the following line in the `<head>` of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.0/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-Xi8rHCmBmhdi5ykiixUrfJR/lDjXfd+jNejKrZ8GxR3pGyMakjrGLtkXFugiVDUO" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### Final Notes

- Make sure you're using the correct version of `rehype-katex` and KaTeX that are compatible with each other.
- If you're using a static site generator or a framework like Next.js or Gatsby, you might need to configure it to use this pipeline for processing Markdown files.

By following these steps, you should be able to render fenced LaTeX code blocks in your Markdown documents using `rehype-katex`.
