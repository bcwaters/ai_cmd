# Unit Testing in Pure JavaScript Node App

For unit testing in a pure JavaScript Node application, **Jest** is highly recommended. Here's why:

- **Ease of Setup**: Jest is easy to set up and integrate into your Node.js project.
- **Feature-Rich**: It comes with features like mocking, code coverage, and snapshot testing out of the box.
- **Community Support**: It has a large community and is actively maintained by Facebook, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest JavaScript features.
- **Fast and Safe**: Jest runs tests in parallel, making it fast, and it provides an isolated environment for each test, which is crucial for unit testing.

To get started with Jest in your project, you can simply install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Then, update your `package.json` to use Jest as your test script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Now, you can write your tests in files that end with `.test.js` or `.spec.js`. Here's a simple example of how to test a utility function:

```javascript
// util.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = add;

// util.test.js
const add = require('./util');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Run your tests with `npm test`, and Jest will execute them.
