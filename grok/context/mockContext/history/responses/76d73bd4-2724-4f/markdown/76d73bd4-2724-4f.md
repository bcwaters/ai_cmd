# Testing Audio Levels

It seems like you are testing your audio setup. Here is a simple guide on how to effectively test your audio levels:

1. **Speak Clearly:** Start by speaking into your microphone at a normal volume. Say "testing one two" or any other phrase.
2. **Check Levels:** Monitor the audio levels on your recording software to ensure they are neither too low nor peaking.
3. **Adjust as Needed:** If the levels are too low, increase the microphone gain. If they're too high, decrease it to avoid distortion.

Is your audio setup working well for you? Here are a few follow-up questions you might consider:

- Are you using any specific software for audio recording?
- Have you experienced any issues with background noise?
- Do you need help setting up noise cancellation?
