# Elephant Overview

## Intelligence
Elephants are renowned for their high level of intelligence, which is evident in their problem-solving abilities and complex social behaviors. Studies have shown that elephants can use tools, such as using sticks to scratch themselves or to reach food. They also exhibit a remarkable memory, often referred to as an "elephant's memory," which allows them to recognize other elephants and humans they have met even after many years.

## Family Bonds
Elephant family units are matriarchal, led by the oldest female, and are characterized by strong emotional bonds. These family units consist of related females and their offspring. Elephants engage in alloparenting, where all females in the group help to care for the young. This social structure is crucial for the survival of the young, as they learn social and survival skills from their family members.

## Size and Physical Characteristics
Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African elephants, which are further divided into savanna and forest elephants, can weigh up to 22,000 pounds and stand up to 13 feet tall. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, weighing up to 11,000 pounds and standing up to 10 feet tall. Both species have large ears used for thermoregulation, long trunks used for various tasks like drinking, eating, and social interactions, and tusks used for feeding and defense.

## Habitat
Elephants inhabit a range of habitats across Africa and Asia. African elephants are found in savannas, grasslands, and forests, while Asian elephants are found in forests and grasslands. Their habitat choice is influenced by the availability of food and water, and they are known to migrate seasonally to find these resources.

## Conservation Status
Both African and Asian elephants are facing threats from habitat loss due to human encroachment and poaching for their ivory tusks. The African elephant is listed as "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classified as "endangered." Conservation efforts are focused on habitat protection, anti-poaching initiatives, and efforts to mitigate human-elephant conflict.
