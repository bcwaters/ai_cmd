# 6th Grade Geometry Lesson Plan: Introduction to the Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometry

## Lesson Objective
Students will understand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem to solve real-world and mathematical problems. They will also be introduced to basic concepts of trigonometry as a breadcrumb for further exploration.

## Materials
- Whiteboard and markers
- Textbooks
- Worksheets
- Calculators
- Rulers and protractors

## Introduction (10 minutes)
Begin the lesson by introducing the Pythagorean Theorem. Write the theorem on the board:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Explain that this theorem relates to the sides of a right triangle, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs and $c$ is the hypotenuse. Provide a brief history of Pythagoras and his contributions to mathematics.

## Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
1. **Demonstrate the theorem:** Use a right triangle drawn on the board to show how the theorem works. Solve a simple problem, such as finding the length of the hypotenuse when the legs are given.

   Example: If $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, then $c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$.

2. **Introduce trigonometry:** Explain that trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. Introduce the basic trigonometric ratios: sine, cosine, and tangent.

   $$
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   $$

   $$
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   $$

   $$
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
   $$

   Use a right triangle to illustrate these ratios.

## Guided Practice (15 minutes)
Distribute worksheets with problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem. Work through the first problem together as a class, then allow students to work in pairs on the remaining problems. Circulate to provide assistance and check for understanding.

## Independent Practice (15 minutes)
Students will complete a set of problems independently that require them to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find missing side lengths. Include some problems that hint at trigonometry, asking students to identify which sides are opposite, adjacent, or the hypotenuse in relation to a given angle.

## Assessment (10 minutes)
- **Formative Assessment:** Use exit tickets to assess students' understanding of the Pythagorean Theorem. Ask them to solve one problem using the theorem.
- **Summative Assessment:** Plan for a quiz in the next class to evaluate their mastery of the concept.

## Closure (5 minutes)
Summarize the key points of the lesson. Encourage students to think about how the Pythagorean Theorem can be applied in real life, such as in construction or navigation. Briefly mention the expanded theorem for further reading.

## Further Reading: Expanded Pythagorean Theorem
For students interested in exploring more, introduce the expanded Pythagorean Theorem, which can be used for any triangle:

$$
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of the triangle, and $d$ is the length of the median to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. This can be a starting point for advanced students to delve deeper into geometry and trigonometry.
