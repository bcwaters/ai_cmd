Here's an example of a Python script that demonstrates the use of functions and list comprehension to process data:

```python
# This script processes a list of numbers to find even numbers and their squares

def is_even(num):
    """
    Check if a number is even.
    
    Args:
    num (int): The number to check.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.
    """
    return num % 2 == 0

def square(num):
    """
    Calculate the square of a number.
    
    Args:
    num (int): The number to square.
    
    Returns:
    int: The square of the number.
    """
    return num ** 2

# Sample list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use list comprehension to create a list of squares of even numbers
even_squares = [square(num) for num in numbers if is_even(num)]

# Print the result
print("Squares of even numbers:", even_squares)
```

This code showcases basic Python concepts like function definitions, list comprehension, and simple data processing.
