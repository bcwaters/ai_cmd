# Equilateral, Isosceles, and Obtuse Triangles

## Equilateral Triangle

An **equilateral triangle** is a special type of triangle where all three sides are of equal length and all angles are equal to $60^\circ$. 

- **Definition**: A triangle with all sides equal and all angles equal to $60^\circ$.
- **Properties**:
  - All sides are congruent: $a = b = c$.
  - All angles are congruent: $\angle A = \angle B = \angle C = 60^\circ$.
  - The triangle is also equiangular.

## Isosceles Triangle

An **isosceles triangle** is a triangle that has at least two sides of equal length. The angles opposite these equal sides are also equal.

- **Definition**: A triangle with at least two sides of equal length.
- **Properties**:
  - Two sides are congruent: $a = b$ or $b = c$ or $a = c$.
  - The angles opposite the equal sides are congruent: $\angle A = \angle B$ or $\angle B = \angle C$ or $\angle A = \angle C$.
  - The altitude from the vertex angle to the base bisects the base and the vertex angle.

## Obtuse Triangle

An **obtuse triangle** is a triangle that has one angle greater than $90^\circ$ but less than $180^\circ$. The other two angles must be acute (less than $90^\circ$).

- **Definition**: A triangle with one angle greater than $90^\circ$.
- **Properties**:
  - One angle is obtuse: $\angle A > 90^\circ$ or $\angle B > 90^\circ$ or $\angle C > 90^\circ$.
  - The other two angles are acute: $\angle A < 90^\circ$, $\angle B < 90^\circ$, and $\angle C < 90^\circ$.
  - The longest side is opposite the obtuse angle.

These definitions and properties help distinguish between these types of triangles and are fundamental in geometric studies.
