Here's a basic example of a TensorFlow.js program that can be used to detect AI-generated images. This example uses a pre-trained model to classify images as either AI-generated or not. Note that this is a simplified version and real-world applications might require more sophisticated models and preprocessing.

```javascript
// Import TensorFlow.js
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Load the pre-trained model
async function loadModel() {
  const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/your/model.json');
  return model;
}

// Function to preprocess the image
function preprocessImage(image) {
  // Convert the image to a tensor
  let tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(image).toFloat();
  
  // Normalize the tensor
  const offset = tf.scalar(255.0);
  tensor = tensor.div(offset);
  
  // Resize the tensor to match the model's input shape
  const resized = tf.image.resizeBilinear(tensor, [224, 224]);
  
  // Expand the tensor to add a batch dimension
  const batched = resized.expandDims(0);
  
  return batched;
}

// Function to predict if the image is AI-generated
async function predict(model, image) {
  const processedImage = preprocessImage(image);
  const prediction = await model.predict(processedImage);
  
  // Assuming the model outputs a single value between 0 and 1
  // where 1 indicates AI-generated and 0 indicates not AI-generated
  const result = prediction.dataSync()[0];
  
  processedImage.dispose();
  prediction.dispose();
  
  return result > 0.5 ? 'AI-Generated' : 'Not AI-Generated';
}

// Main function to run the detection
async function main() {
  const model = await loadModel();
  const image = document.getElementById('myImage'); // Assuming you have an image element with id 'myImage'
  
  const result = await predict(model, image);
  console.log('The image is:', result);
}

// Call the main function
main();
```

**Important Notes:**
- You'll need to replace `'path/to/your/model.json'` with the actual path to your pre-trained model.
- The model's architecture and training data significantly affect the accuracy of detection. Ensure you use a model specifically trained for AI-generated image detection.
- The threshold of `0.5` in the `predict` function can be adjusted based on your model's performance and requirements.
- Make sure to handle any errors and manage memory properly in a production environment.

This code provides a basic framework for detecting AI-generated images using TensorFlow.js. You might need to adjust it based on your specific model and requirements.
