```markdown
### Setting Up a Node.js Server

To set up a Node.js server, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from the official website.
2. **Create a Server File**: Create a file named `server.js`.
3. **Write Server Code**: Use the following code to start a basic server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World
');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

4. **Run the Server**: Execute `node server.js` in your terminal.

For more complex setups, consider using frameworks like Express.js.
```
