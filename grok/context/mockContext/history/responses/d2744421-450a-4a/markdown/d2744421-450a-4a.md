# Testing in Markdown

Here is a simple example of how to format a test case in Markdown:

```markdown
### Test Case: Example

**Description:** This test checks if the function returns the correct output.

**Steps:**
1. Input the value `5` into the function.
2. Execute the function.
3. Compare the output to the expected result `25`.

**Expected Result:** The function should return `25`.

**Actual Result:** The function returned `25`.

**Status:** Passed
```

This format helps in clearly documenting and sharing test results.

### Follow-up Questions:
- Do you need help with writing test cases in a specific programming language?
- Would you like to see more examples of test case documentation?
- Are there particular aspects of testing you're interested in learning more about?
