Here's another simple code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to take user input and perform a basic operation:

```python
# This program asks for the user's name and greets them

# Ask for the user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Greet the user
print("Hello, " + name + "! Nice to meet you.")
```

This snippet introduces the `input()` function, which allows the program to receive input from the user, and concatenates strings to form a personalized greeting.
