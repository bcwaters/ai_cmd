In the realm of **computational theory**, understanding the complexity of algorithms is crucial. For instance, the time complexity of an algorithm can be expressed using Big O notation, which gives an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's runtime. In LaTeX, this can be written as $O(n^2)$ for an algorithm with quadratic time complexity.

Another important concept is the Turing machine, a theoretical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. The transition function of a Turing machine can be represented in LaTeX as $\delta(q, a) = (q', a', D)$, where $q$ and $q'$ are states, $a$ and $a'$ are symbols, and $D$ is the direction of movement.

In the study of decidability, the halting problem is famously undecidable. This can be expressed in LaTeX as: Given a program $P$ and input $I$, it is impossible to determine in general whether $P$ will halt on $I$, symbolized as $\text{Halt}(P, I)$.

Lastly, in the context of automata theory, a regular expression for a language that accepts strings of $a$'s and $b$'s where the number of $a$'s is even can be written as $(ab^*a)^*b^*$ in LaTeX.
