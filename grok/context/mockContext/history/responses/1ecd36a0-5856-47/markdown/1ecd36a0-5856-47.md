# Testing Command Sequence

Here's how you can test the `grep` command with additional flags in a bash environment:

## Basic `grep` Command

The `grep` command is used for searching text using patterns. Here's a basic usage:

```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt
```

## Adding Flags

To enhance the functionality of `grep`, you can use various flags:

- `-i` for case-insensitive search
- `-r` for recursive search in directories
- `-n` to include line numbers in the output

Here's an example with multiple flags:

```bash
grep -inr "pattern" directory/
```

## Multiple Files and Sequential Commands

If you want to search through multiple files or use sequential commands, you can do the following:

```bash
grep -in "pattern" file1.txt file2.txt
```

Or for sequential commands:

```bash
grep -in "pattern1" file1.txt | grep -in "pattern2"
```

## Example Usage

Let's say you want to search for the word "testing" in multiple files within a directory, case-insensitively, and with line numbers:

```bash
grep -inr "testing" /path/to/directory/
```

## Shell Command Documentation Format

When documenting shell commands, it's useful to include:

- The command itself
- A brief explanation
- Example usage
- Expected output

## Testing Functionality

To confirm the sequence works as expected, you can test with known inputs:

```bash
echo "Testing one two three" > testfile.txt
grep -in "testing" testfile.txt
```

Expected output:

```
1:Testing one two three
```
