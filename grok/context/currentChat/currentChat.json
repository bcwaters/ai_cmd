Your goal is to create a robust, high-performance system that integrates the following components and technologies:\n\n### **Microservices Architecture** *(Frame: NestJS)*\n- Use TypeScript to implement microservices, ensuring improved scalability, fault isolation, and easier maintenance.\n\n### **Load Balancing** *(Frame: Nginx, AWS ELB)*\n- Set up Nginx and AWS ELB to distribute traffic across multiple instances, avoiding single points of failure and handling high traffic.\n\n### **Database Design** *(Frame: PostgreSQL, MongoDB)*\n- Implement PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for NoSQL data, ensuring efficient data handling and scalability.\n\n### **Caching** *(Frame: Redis)*\n- Integrate Redis for caching to reduce database load and improve response times.\n\n### **Containerization and Orchestration** *(Frame: Docker, Kubernetes)*\n- Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration to ensure consistent deployment environments and easy scaling.\n\n### **Monitoring and Logging** *(Frame: Prometheus, ELK stack)*\n- Implement Prometheus for monitoring and the ELK stack for logging to identify performance bottlenecks and issues in real-time.\n\n### **API Gateway** *(Frame: AWS API Gateway, Kong)*\n- Set up AWS API Gateway or Kong to centralize API management, providing features like authentication, rate limiting, and analytics.\n\n### **Asynchronous Processing** *(Frame: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)*\n- Use RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for asynchronous processing to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main thread.\n\n### **Security** *(Frame: NestJS, Various Security Tools)*\n- Implement security measures within NestJS and integrate various security tools to protect the application from threats.\n\n### **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** *(Frame: Jenkins)*\n- Set up Jenkins for CI/CD to automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring consistent and reliable updates.\n\n### **Additional Requirements:**\n- Provide clear, modular code structures with appropriate comments and documentation.\n- Ensure the system is designed to be scalable and maintainable.\n- Include any necessary configuration files and setup instructions.\n\nPlease generate the necessary code and configurations for each component, focusing on integration and ensuring they work seamlessly together within the NestJS framework. \n\n---\n\nThis prompt provides a clear and detailed description of the architecture, specifying the technologies and frameworks to be used, and outlines the additional requirements for the code. This should help Claude understand the task and produce the required code effectively.\n\n@EOF@\nKEYWORDS: NestJS, TypeScript, microservices, load balancing, Nginx, AWS ELB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, ELK stack, AWS API Gateway, Kong, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, security, Jenkins, CI/CD, scalable architecture","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1173,"completion_tokens":573,"total_tokens":1746,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":1173,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c612364da3"}
