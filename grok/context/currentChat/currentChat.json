It's particularly useful for enhancing the readability of README files by adding color to the text, making it more engaging and easier to follow.\n\n## Installation\n\n### On Ubuntu/Debian\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install highlight\n```\n\n### Using Homebrew (for macOS)\n\n```bash\nbrew install highlight\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use `highlight` for README files, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nhighlight -O ansi your-readme-file.md\n```\n\nThis command will output the contents of your README file with syntax highlighting directly to the terminal. The `-O ansi` option specifies that the output should be formatted with ANSI escape codes, which are used for coloring in terminals.\n\n## Customization\n\n`highlight` offers various options for customization:\n\n- **Themes**: You can choose different themes for syntax highlighting by using the `--style` option. For example:\n\n  ```bash\n  highlight --style solarized-light -O ansi your-readme-file.md\n  ```\n\n- **Line Numbers**: To include line numbers in your output, use the `--line-numbers` option:\n\n  ```bash\n  highlight --line-numbers -O ansi your-readme-file.md\n  ```\n\n- **Output to File**: If you want to save the highlighted output to a file instead of displaying it in the terminal, you can use the `-o` option:\n\n  ```bash\n  highlight -O ansi your-readme-file.md -o highlighted-readme.txt\n  ```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with `highlight`, consider the following:\n\n- **Syntax Errors**: Ensure that your Markdown syntax is correct. `highlight` may not handle malformed Markdown well.\n- **Color Issues**: If colors do not appear, check your terminal settings to ensure it supports ANSI colors.\n- **Installation Problems**: If installation fails, verify that your package manager is up to date or try an alternative installation method.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor more detailed documentation and examples, visit the official `highlight` website or refer to its man pages:\n\n```bash\nman highlight\n```\n\nBy using `highlight`, you can significantly improve the visual appeal and readability of your README files, making them more accessible to your audience.\n\n@EOF@\nhighlight, README, syntax-highlighting, terminal, ANSI, customization, themes, line-numbers, troubleshooting, installation, Ubuntu, Homebrew, Markdown","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":718,"completion_tokens":509,"total_tokens":1227,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":718,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
