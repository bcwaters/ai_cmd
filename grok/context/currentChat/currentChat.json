It's also commonly referred to as the American Hophornbeam due to its resemblance to the European Hophornbeam. Here's a comprehensive look at the Ironwood tree:\n\n## Characteristics\n\n- **Height**: Typically grows between 25 to 40 feet tall, with some reaching up to 50 feet.\n- **Bark**: The bark is grayish-brown and has a distinctive shreddy appearance, which adds to its ornamental value.\n- **Leaves**: The leaves are oval-shaped, with a doubly serrated margin, and turn a bright yellow in the fall.\n- **Wood**: The wood is extremely hard and dense, hence the name \"Ironwood\". It's so hard that it can blunt the edges of cutting tools.\n\n## Habitat and Growth\n\n- **Range**: Found from Nova Scotia west to Manitoba, and south to eastern Texas and northern Florida.\n- **Soil**: Prefers well-drained, moist soils but can tolerate a variety of soil conditions, including clay.\n- **Growth Rate**: Slow-growing, often taking 20-30 years to reach maturity.\n\n## Uses\n\n- **Timber**: The wood, though hard to work with, is used for tool handles, fence posts, and other applications where durability is crucial.\n- **Landscaping**: Often used in landscaping due to its attractive bark and fall color. It's also valued for its resistance to pests and diseases.\n- **Wildlife**: The tree provides food for wildlife, with its seeds being a food source for birds and small mammals.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n\n- **Native American Uses**: Various Native American tribes used the wood for tools and weapons, and the bark for medicinal purposes.\n- **Folklore**: In some cultures, the Ironwood tree is considered a symbol of strength and resilience.\n\n## Care and Maintenance\n\n- **Pruning**: Requires minimal pruning, mainly to remove dead or damaged branches.\n- **Pests and Diseases**: Generally resistant, but can occasionally be affected by pests like the hophornbeam psyllid or diseases like powdery mildew.\n\n## Interesting Facts\n\n- The Ironwood tree can live for over 100 years, with some specimens reaching 150 years or more.\n- Its scientific name, *Ostrya virginiana*, comes from the Greek word \"ostrys\" meaning \"bone-like\", referring to the hardness of its wood.\n\nIn summary, the Ironwood tree is a hardy, slow-growing tree with significant ornamental and practical value. Its hard wood, attractive bark, and resistance to pests make it a valuable addition to landscapes and forests alike.\n\n@EOF@\n[Ironwood tree, Ostrya virginiana, American Hophornbeam, deciduous, eastern North America, hard wood, landscaping, wildlife, Native American, strength, resilience, slow-growing, pest resistance]","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":661,"completion_tokens":605,"total_tokens":1266,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":661,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_5c0c5bd9d9"}
