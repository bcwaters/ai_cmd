Here is a 10-sentence example with the Arizona eviction notice disclaimer at the bottom:

```markdown
1. **Introduction**: Good communication is key when dealing with tenant issues, especially during the eviction process.
2. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all interactions, including dates, times, and the content of discussions.
3. **Lease Agreement**: Review the lease agreement to understand the terms and conditions that both parties agreed upon.
4. **Initial Contact**: Reach out to the tenant to discuss any violations or issues, such as the bounced check or unauthorized residents.
5. **Resolution Attempt**: Offer the tenant a chance to resolve the issues before moving forward with legal action.
6. **Eviction Notice**: If the tenant does not comply, serve them with an eviction notice, specifying the reasons and the timeframe for response.
7. **Legal Process**: Understand that filing an eviction lawsuit can be time-consuming and may take several weeks to resolve.
8. **Professionalism**: Maintain a professional demeanor throughout the process to ensure a smooth and legally compliant eviction.
9. **Support Systems**: Be aware of local resources that can assist tenants in difficult situations, such as housing assistance programs.
10. **Follow-Up**: After serving the eviction notice, follow up with the tenant to see if they have taken any steps to remedy the situation.

**Disclaimer**: In Arizona, the eviction process cannot be completed within a week. After serving the eviction notice, the tenant has five days to respond. If they do not comply, you must file an eviction lawsuit, which can take several weeks to resolve before the tenant is legally removed from the property.

When serving the eviction notice, you might say:

"Hello [Tenant's Name], I am serving you with an eviction notice due to the bounced check for rent and the unauthorized resident living in the property. You have five days to remedy these issues or vacate the premises. Please understand that this is a formal legal process, and I am obligated to follow through if the situation is not resolved. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you."
```
