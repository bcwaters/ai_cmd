# Guidance on Evicting a Tenant

Before we proceed with detailed guidance on how to approach the eviction, let's refine your question with a few clarifications:

1. **Legal Requirements**: Are you aware of the specific legal requirements and procedures for eviction in your jurisdiction? This can vary significantly and is crucial for a lawful eviction process.

2. **Communication History**: Have you had any prior communication with the tenant regarding the bounced check and the unauthorized resident? If so, what was discussed?

3. **Documentation**: Do you have all necessary documentation ready, such as the lease agreement, bounced check, and any correspondence with the tenant?

4. **Support System**: Do you have legal or professional support to assist during the eviction process? This could include a lawyer or a property management company.

Once you provide answers to these questions, I can offer a more tailored approach to serving the eviction notice in a firm yet non-confrontational manner.
