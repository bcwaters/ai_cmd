# TensorFlow: Rank of an Image

In TensorFlow, the **rank** of a tensor refers to the number of dimensions it has. When discussing the rank of an image, we're essentially talking about the dimensionality of the tensor that represents the image.

### Understanding Image Rank in TensorFlow

- **2D Image (Rank 2):**
  A simple grayscale image is typically represented as a 2D tensor, where the rank is 2. This tensor has dimensions of height and width.
  ```javascript
  const image2D = tf.tensor2d([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
  console.log(image2D.shape); // [2, 2]
  ```

- **3D Image (Rank 3):**
  A color image is often represented as a 3D tensor, where the rank is 3. This tensor includes dimensions of height, width, and channels (e.g., RGB).
  ```javascript
  const image3D = tf.tensor3d([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]);
  console.log(image3D.shape); // [2, 2, 3]
  ```

- **4D Image (Rank 4):**
  In machine learning, especially for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), images are often processed in batches. A batch of images is represented as a 4D tensor, with dimensions of batch size, height, width, and channels.
  ```javascript
  const imageBatch = tf.tensor4d([[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]], [[[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]], [[19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24]]]]);
  console.log(imageBatch.shape); // [2, 2, 2, 3]
  ```

Understanding the rank of an image is crucial for operations like reshaping, slicing, and applying convolutional layers in TensorFlow.
