In Arizona, the eviction process cannot be completed within a week. After serving the eviction notice, the tenant has five days to respond. If they do not comply, you must file an eviction lawsuit, which can take several weeks to resolve before the tenant is legally removed from the property.

When serving the eviction notice, you might say:

"Hello [Tenant's Name], I am serving you with an eviction notice due to the bounced check for rent and the unauthorized resident living in the property. You have five days to remedy these issues or vacate the premises. Please understand that this is a formal legal process, and I am obligated to follow through if the situation is not resolved. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you."
