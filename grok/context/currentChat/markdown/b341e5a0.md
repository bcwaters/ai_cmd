#### Vegetables:

1. **Lettuce (Lactuca sativa):**
   - **Type:** Leafy green, cool-season crop.
   - **Planting:** Sow seeds directly into the soil after the last frost, around mid-April in Fayetteville. Lettuce prefers cooler temperatures and can be grown successively for a continuous harvest.
   - **Care:** Requires consistent moisture, especially during germination and growth. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Use mulch to retain soil moisture.
   - **Harvesting:** Can be harvested as baby greens or allowed to mature. Cut leaves when they reach the desired size, and the plant will continue to produce.

2. **Radishes (Raphanus sativus):**
   - **Type:** Root vegetable, fast-growing.
   - **Planting:** Sow seeds directly into the soil in early spring, as soon as the soil can be worked. Radishes prefer cooler temperatures and grow quickly, ready to harvest in about 20-30 days.
   - **Care:** Requires minimal care, just ensure the soil stays moist until germination. Thin seedlings to prevent overcrowding.
   - **Harvesting:** Pull radishes when they reach the desired size, typically when the root is about 1 inch in diameter.

3. **Spinach (Spinacia oleracea):**
   - **Type:** Leafy green, cool-season crop.
   - **Planting:** Sow seeds directly into the soil or start indoors and transplant after the last frost. Spinach prefers cooler temperatures and can bolt (go to seed) in hot weather.
   - **Care:** Keep the soil consistently moist and provide shade in hot weather to prevent bolting. Use mulch to maintain soil moisture.
   - **Harvesting:** Can be harvested as baby greens or allowed to mature. Cut leaves from the outer edges, allowing the plant to continue producing.

   - **Type:** Warm-season herb.
   - **Planting:** Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost and transplant seedlings after the danger of frost has passed. Basil needs full sun and warm temperatures.
   - **Care:** Water regularly to keep the soil moist. Pinch off flowers to encourage leaf growth. Use mulch to retain soil moisture.
   - **Harvesting:** Harvest leaves as needed, starting from the top to encourage bushier growth. Can be harvested throughout the growing season.

2. **Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare):**
   - **Type:** Perennial herb, but often grown as an annual.
   - **Planting:** Sow seeds directly into the soil after the last frost. Fennel prefers full sun and well-drained soil.
   - **Care:** Water consistently, especially during dry spells. Fennel can grow quite large, so give it space. Use mulch to retain soil moisture.

#### Fruits:

1. **Paw Paw (Asimina triloba):**

   - **Planting:** Plant in a sunny location with well-drained soil. Paw paws are well-suited to Arkansas's climate, particularly in the Ozark region, which includes Fayetteville.
   - **Care:** Water regularly during the first year to establish roots. Mulch around the base to retain moisture and protect the roots. Prune in late winter to maintain shape and health.
   - **Harvesting:** Paw paws typically take 3-5 years to produce fruit. Harvest when the fruit is soft to the touch and has a sweet aroma, usually in late summer to early fall.

**Native Status of Paw Paw in the Region:**
The Paw Paw tree is native to the eastern United States, including Arkansas. It thrives in the Ozark region, which encompasses Fayetteville. Its native status makes it an excellent choice for local gardens, as it is well-adapted to the area's soil and climate conditions.

### Steps for Starting Your Organic Garden:

1. **Soil Preparation:**
   - Test your soil for pH and nutrient levels. Add compost to improve soil fertility and structure. This is crucial for organic gardening as it helps maintain soil health without synthetic fertilizers.

2. **Planting:**
   - Start with seeds indoors for plants like basil, fennel, and cilantro, or purchase seedlings for immediate planting after the last frost.
   - For vegetables like lettuce, radishes, and spinach, you can sow seeds directly into the soil after the last frost.

3. **Watering and Care:**
   - Water consistently, especially in the early stages of growth. Use drip irrigation or a watering can to avoid wetting the leaves, which can lead to disease.
   - Use organic mulch like straw or leaves to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

4. **Pest and Disease Management:**
   - Monitor your garden regularly for signs of pests or disease. Use organic methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap to manage issues.
   - Encourage beneficial insects by planting flowers that attract them, such as marigolds or dill.

5. **Harvesting:**
   - Harvest vegetables and herbs at the peak of ripeness for the best flavor. For paw paws, wait until they are soft and fragrant before harvesting.
