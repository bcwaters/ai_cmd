# TensorFlow.js: Type Constants

Yes, TensorFlow.js provides constants to refer to each data type. These constants are part of the `tf` namespace and can be used directly in your code. Here are some of the type constants available in TensorFlow.js:

- `tf.bool`: Represents boolean values.
- `tf.int32`: Represents 32-bit integer values.
- `tf.float32`: Represents 32-bit floating-point values.
- `tf.uint8`: Represents unsigned 8-bit integer values.

You can use these constants when specifying the data type for operations like `tf.cast()`. Here's an example of how to use `tf.uint8` in a casting operation:

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

// Create a float32 tensor
const floatTensor = tf.tensor([1.2, 2.7, 3.8]);

// Cast the tensor to uint8 using the tf.uint8 constant
const uint8Tensor = tf.cast(floatTensor, tf.uint8);

// Print the result
uint8Tensor.print();
```

This code will output the same result as in the previous example:

```
Tensor
    [[1, 3, 4],]
```

Using these constants can make your code more readable and less prone to errors, as you don't have to remember the string representations of the data types.
