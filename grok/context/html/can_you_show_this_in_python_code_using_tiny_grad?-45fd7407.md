Here's an implementation of Sobel edge detection using TinyGrad in Python. TinyGrad is a lightweight deep learning framework that can also be used for basic image processing tasks like convolution. Let's go through the implementation step-by-step:

```python
import tinygrad.tensor as ts
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def sobel_edge_detection_tinygrad(image):
    # Convert image to grayscale if it's not already
    if len(image.shape) == 3:
        image = np.mean(image, axis=2).astype(np.float32)
    
    # Convert to TinyGrad tensor
    img_tensor = ts.Tensor(image)
    
    # Define Sobel kernels
    sobel_x = ts.Tensor(np.array([[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]).astype(np.float32))
    sobel_y = ts.Tensor(np.array([[-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]).astype(np.float32))
    
    # Apply Sobel filters
    gx = ts.abs(img_tensor.conv2d(sobel_x))
    gy = ts.abs(img_tensor.conv2d(sobel_y))
    
    # Calculate gradient magnitude
    g = ts.sqrt(gx**2 + gy**2)
    
    # Convert back to numpy array
    g_np = g.numpy()
    
    # Normalize gradient magnitude to 0-255 range
    g_normalized = (g_np / np.max(g_np) * 255).astype(np.uint8)
    
    # Thresholding (example threshold)
    threshold = 100
    edges = (g_normalized > threshold).astype(np.uint8) * 255
    
    return edges

# Example usage
# Load an image (replace with your actual image loading method)
image = plt.imread('path_to_image.jpg')

# Detect edges
edges = sobel_edge_detection_tinygrad(image)

# Display the result
plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```

This implementation uses TinyGrad's `conv2d` function to perform the convolution operation, which is equivalent to the `convolve2d` function used in the NumPy implementation. Here are some key points about this implementation:

1. We convert the input image to a TinyGrad tensor before applying the convolution.
2. The Sobel kernels are also converted to TinyGrad tensors.
3. We use `conv2d` for both horizontal and vertical gradient calculations.
4. The rest of the process (calculating gradient magnitude, normalizing, and thresholding) is similar to the NumPy implementation, but we convert back to a NumPy array for these operations.

Note that TinyGrad is primarily designed for deep learning tasks, so it might not be the most efficient choice for basic image processing operations like Sobel edge detection. However, it can be useful for educational purposes or for integrating edge detection into a larger deep learning pipeline.
