# The Ark of the Covenant and Its Alleged Location in Ethiopia

The Ark of the Covenant is a sacred artifact described in the Bible, believed to house the stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments given to Moses by God. Its last known location according to the biblical narrative is in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. However, various traditions and legends suggest different fates for the Ark after the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BCE.

One popular claim is that the Ark of the Covenant is located in Ethiopia, specifically in the city of Aksum. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church asserts that the Ark was brought to Ethiopia by Menelik I, the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. According to this tradition, Menelik I visited his father in Jerusalem and, upon his return to Ethiopia, took the Ark with him. It is believed to be housed in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Aksum, where it is guarded by a single monk who is the only one allowed to see it.

While this claim is widely held within Ethiopian culture and religion, there is no definitive archaeological or historical evidence to confirm the Ark's presence in Ethiopia. The story remains a matter of faith and tradition rather than proven fact.
