Certainly! TensorFlow.js provides access to several pre-trained models that you can use directly in your web applications. Here are some popular models available through TensorFlow.js:

### 1. **MobileNet**
MobileNet is a lightweight deep neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It's particularly useful for image classification tasks.

```javascript
import * as mobilenet from '@tensorflow-models/mobilenet';

async function loadMobileNet() {
  const model = await mobilenet.load();
  const img = document.getElementById('myImage');
  const predictions = await model.classify(img);
  console.log('Predictions:', predictions);
}

loadMobileNet();
```

### 2. **COCO-SSD**
COCO-SSD is a real-time object detection model trained on the COCO dataset. It can identify and locate multiple objects within an image.

```javascript
import * as cocoSsd from '@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd';

async function loadCocoSsd() {
  const model = await cocoSsd.load();
  const img = document.getElementById('myImage');
  const predictions = await model.detect(img);
  console.log('Predictions:', predictions);
}

loadCocoSsd();
```

### 3. **PoseNet**
PoseNet can estimate human poses in real-time from images or video. It's widely used for applications like fitness tracking or interactive games.

```javascript
import * as posenet from '@tensorflow-models/posenet';

async function loadPoseNet() {
  const model = await posenet.load();
  const img = document.getElementById('myImage');
  const poses = await model.estimateSinglePose(img);
  console.log('Poses:', poses);
}

loadPoseNet();
```

### 4. **FaceLandmark68Net**
This model can detect and landmark 68 points on a human face, useful for facial recognition and analysis.

```javascript
import * as faceLandmarksDetection from '@tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection';

async function loadFaceLandmark68Net() {
  const model = await faceLandmarksDetection.load(faceLandmarksDetection.SupportedPackages.mediapipeFacemesh);
  const img = document.getElementById('myImage');
  const predictions = await model.estimateFaces({input: img});
  console.log('Predictions:', predictions);
}

loadFaceLandmark68Net();
```

### 5. **BodyPix**
BodyPix is used for person segmentation, which can be used to create effects like background removal or virtual try-on experiences.

```javascript
import * as bodyPix from '@tensorflow-models/body-pix';

async function loadBodyPix() {
  const net = await bodyPix.load();
  const img = document.getElementById('myImage');
  const segmentation = await net.segmentPerson(img);
  console.log('Segmentation:', segmentation);
}

loadBodyPix();
```

These models can be easily integrated into your web applications to add advanced machine learning functionalities without the need to train your own models from scratch. Each model comes with its own API and documentation, so you can explore further details and examples on how to use them effectively.
