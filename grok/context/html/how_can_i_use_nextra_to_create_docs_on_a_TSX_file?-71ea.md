To use Nextra to create documentation on a TSX file, you can leverage Nextra's support for MDX, which allows you to embed JSX and TypeScript directly within your Markdown files. Here's how you can set up and use Nextra with a TSX file:

### Step 1: Setting Up Nextra

First, ensure that you have Nextra installed in your Next.js project. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
npm install nextra
```

### Step 2: Configuring Nextra

Next, you need to configure Nextra in your `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.js',
})

module.exports = withNextra()
```

And in your `theme.config.js`, you can customize the theme settings:

```javascript
export default {
  logo: <strong>My Docs</strong>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/your-project',
  },
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/your-project/tree/main',
  footer: {
    text: 'My Documentation',
  },
}
```

### Step 3: Creating a TSX Documentation File

Create a new file with a `.mdx` extension (e.g., `getting-started.mdx`) in your `pages` directory. Inside this file, you can use Nextra annotations and embed TSX code:

```markdown
---
title: Getting Started with My Project
description: Learn how to set up and use My Project.
sidebarLabel: Quick Start
draft: false
---

# Getting Started with My Project

Welcome to the quick start guide for My Project. Here's how to get started:

## Installation

To install My Project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install my-project
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use My Project in your React components:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { MyComponent } from 'my-project';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we import `MyComponent` from `my-project` and use it in our `App` component.

## Next Steps

Continue exploring the documentation to learn more about My Project's features and capabilities.
```

### Step 4: Running Your Nextra Documentation

With your TSX documentation file set up, you can now run your Next.js application to see the documentation in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view your documentation at `localhost:3000`.

### Conclusion

By using Nextra with MDX, you can seamlessly integrate TSX code into your documentation, making it easier to demonstrate and explain how to use your TypeScript-based components and libraries.
