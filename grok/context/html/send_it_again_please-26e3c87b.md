To set up TensorFlow.js in the browser, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Include TensorFlow.js in Your Project

You have two main options to include TensorFlow.js in your project:

#### Option 1: Using a CDN

You can directly link to the TensorFlow.js script from a CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest/dist/tf.min.js"></script>
```

#### Option 2: Using npm and a Bundler

If you're using a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup, you can install TensorFlow.js via npm:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
```

Then, import it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
```

### Step 2: Verify the Installation

After including TensorFlow.js, you can verify the installation by running a simple test in your browser's console or in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
console.log(tf.version.tfjs);
```

This should print the version of TensorFlow.js that you have installed.

### Step 3: Start Using TensorFlow.js

Now that TensorFlow.js is set up, you can start using it to build and run machine learning models in the browser. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
// Define a simple model
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));

// Prepare the model for training
model.compile({loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'sgd'});

// Generate some data
const xs = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 1]);
const ys = tf.tensor2d([1, 3, 5, 7], [4, 1]);

// Train the model
await model.fit(xs, ys, {epochs: 100});

// Use the model to predict a value
const prediction = model.predict(tf.tensor2d([5], [1, 1]));
console.log('Prediction:', prediction.dataSync()[0]);
```

This example creates a simple linear regression model, trains it on some data, and makes a prediction.

By following these steps, you should now have TensorFlow.js set up and ready to use in your browser-based projects.
