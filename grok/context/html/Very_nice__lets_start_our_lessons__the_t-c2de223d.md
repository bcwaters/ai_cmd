# Foundational Math Concepts

## Subject 1: Fractions
Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. They consist of a numerator and a denominator. The numerator represents the number of parts you have, while the denominator represents the total number of parts the whole is divided into.

## Subject 2: Addition of Fractions
To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. If they do not, you must find the least common multiple of their denominators and convert both fractions to have this as their new denominator.

```latex
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \cdot d + b \cdot c}{b \cdot d}
```

## Subject 3: Multiplication of Fractions
Multiplying fractions is straightforward. You multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

```latex
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}
```

## Subject 4: Coordinate Geometry
Coordinate geometry deals with plotting points on a coordinate system and understanding their relationships. It's fundamental for graphing and analyzing data in various fields.

### Plotting Points
To plot a point on a coordinate system, you need its coordinates, which are given as an ordered pair (x, y). The x-coordinate represents the horizontal position, while the y-coordinate represents the vertical position.

```latex
\text{Point} = (x, y)
```

### The Coordinate System
The coordinate system is divided into four quadrants. The quadrants are numbered counterclockwise starting from the top right.

- **Quadrant I**: Both x and y are positive.
- **Quadrant II**: x is negative, y is positive.
- **Quadrant III**: Both x and y are negative.
- **Quadrant IV**: x is positive, y is negative.

### Distance Formula
The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) can be calculated using the distance formula:

```latex
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
```

### Graphing
Graphing involves plotting points and connecting them to form lines or curves. This is essential for visualizing mathematical functions and data sets.

### Real-World Applications
Coordinate geometry is used in navigation systems, computer graphics, and engineering to model and analyze physical systems.

### Assessment
Students can be assessed on their ability to plot points, understand the coordinate system, and apply the distance formula through quizzes, practical exercises, and problem-solving tasks.
