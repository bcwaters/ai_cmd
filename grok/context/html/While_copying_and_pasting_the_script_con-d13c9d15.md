### Summary of Script Bundling Methods for Offline Use

When considering how to bundle scripts for offline use within an HTML file, it's important to weigh the simplicity of direct embedding against the efficiency and maintainability offered by more advanced methods. Here's a quick recap of the approaches discussed:

- **Base64 Encoding**: Ideal for small scripts, this method involves converting your JavaScript to Base64 and embedding it directly in the HTML. It's straightforward but can become cumbersome with larger scripts.

- **Data URLs**: Similar to Base64, but you embed the script content directly without encoding. This is more readable but shares the same limitations with file size.

- **Build Tools (Webpack, Rollup)**: These are suited for larger projects. They not only bundle your scripts but also optimize them, handle dependencies, and can inline them into your HTML. Webpack, for instance, can be configured with plugins like `html-webpack-inline-source-plugin` to achieve this.

- **Task Runners (Gulp)**: Useful for automating the process of inlining scripts. Gulp can be configured to take your HTML and JavaScript files and output a single HTML file with scripts inlined, which is great for maintaining a clean workflow.

Each method has its place depending on the scale of your project and your performance requirements. For small projects or prototypes, Base64 or Data URLs might suffice. For larger, more complex applications, leveraging build tools or task runners can significantly enhance both the development process and the end-user experience.
