In most modern IDEs and text editors, there are several keyboard commands for text selection that can significantly boost your productivity. Here are some common selection commands:

### Highlighting the Whole Line

To highlight the entire line where your cursor is currently positioned, you can typically use the following keyboard shortcut:

- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + L`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + L`

This command selects the entire line, allowing you to easily copy, cut, or modify it.

### Other Useful Selection Commands

1. **Select All Text**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + A`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + A`
   This command selects all the text in the current document or file.

2. **Select Word**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + D` (in some IDEs, this might duplicate the line instead)
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + D` (same caveat as above)
   This typically selects the word where the cursor is placed. Note that the exact behavior might differ between IDEs.

3. **Expand Selection**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow` (to expand right) or `Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow` (to expand left)
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + Right Arrow` or `Cmd + Shift + Left Arrow`
   This command allows you to expand your current selection character by character.

4. **Select to Line End/Start**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Shift + End` (to line end) or `Shift + Home` (to line start)
   - **Mac**: `Shift + Right Arrow` (to line end) or `Shift + Left Arrow` (to line start)
   These commands select from the cursor position to the end or start of the line.

5. **Select Multiple Lines**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Shift + Up Arrow` or `Shift + Down Arrow`
   - **Mac**: `Shift + Up Arrow` or `Shift + Down Arrow`
   These commands allow you to select multiple lines by moving the cursor up or down while holding the shift key.

### IDE-Specific Commands

Some IDEs might have additional or slightly different commands. For instance:

- **Visual Studio Code**: `Ctrl + L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + L` (Mac) selects the current line, but `Ctrl + D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + D` (Mac) selects the next occurrence of the current selection, which is useful for multiple cursors.

- **Sublime Text**: Similar to VS Code, but `Ctrl + D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + D` (Mac) will select the next occurrence of the current word.

- **Atom**: `Ctrl + L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + L` (Mac) for line selection, and `Ctrl + D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + D` (Mac) for selecting the next occurrence.

Remember, these shortcuts can be customized in most IDEs, so it's worth checking your specific IDE's settings if these commands don't work as expected.
