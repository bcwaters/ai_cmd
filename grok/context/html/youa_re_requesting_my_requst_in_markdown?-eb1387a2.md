## Description
I need help implementing a function in Python that performs image enhancement using TinyGrad. Specifically, I want to apply adaptive thresholding to an image.

## Requirements
- Use TinyGrad for the implementation.
- The function should take an image as input and return the thresholded image.
- Include comments explaining each step of the process.

## Example Use Case
Here's an example of how I envision using the function:

```python
import tinygrad as tg
from PIL import Image

# Load an image
img = Image.open('example.jpg')

# Apply adaptive thresholding
thresholded_img = adaptive_thresholding(img)

# Display or save the result
thresholded_img.save('thresholded_example.jpg')
```

Please provide the code for the `adaptive_thresholding` function.
