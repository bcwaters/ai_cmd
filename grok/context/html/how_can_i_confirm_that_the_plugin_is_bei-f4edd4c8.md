To confirm that the plugin is being initialized and to check if your `.vimrc` file is being sourced, you can follow these steps:

### Checking if `.vimrc` is Sourced

1. **Add a Test Command:**
   Add a simple command to your `.vimrc` file that will be easy to verify. For example, you can add a message that will be displayed when Vim starts:

   ```vim
   echo "Your .vimrc has been sourced!"
   ```

   After adding this line, restart Vim. If you see the message "Your .vimrc has been sourced!" when Vim starts, then your `.vimrc` file is being sourced correctly.

2. **Check for Errors:**
   Sometimes, errors in your `.vimrc` file can prevent it from being sourced fully. You can check for errors by running Vim from the terminal and looking for any error messages:

   ```bash
   vim -u NONE -c "source ~/.vimrc" -c "q"
   ```

   This command starts Vim without loading any configuration files (`-u NONE`), then sources your `.vimrc` file, and immediately quits (`-c "q"`). Any errors in your `.vimrc` file will be displayed in the terminal.

### Confirming Plugin Initialization

1. **Check Plugin List:**
   After installing the plugins, you can check if they are loaded by using the `:PlugStatus` command in Vim. This will show you a list of all plugins managed by vim-plug and their status.

   ```vim
   :PlugStatus
   ```

   If `vim-polyglot` is listed and shows as "loaded", then it has been initialized correctly.

2. **Check for Plugin-Specific Features:**
   Since `vim-polyglot` is a collection of language packs, you can check if syntax highlighting is working for different file types. Open a file with a specific extension (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript) and see if the syntax highlighting is applied correctly.

3. **Debugging with Verbose Mode:**
   You can start Vim in verbose mode to see detailed information about what is being loaded and executed:

   ```bash
   vim -V20
   ```

   This will output a lot of information to the terminal, including details about plugin loading. Look for lines related to `vim-polyglot` to confirm it's being loaded.

### Additional Tips

- **Ensure `vim-plug` is Installed:**
  Make sure `vim-plug` is installed correctly. You can download it manually or use the installation command provided in the `vim-plug` documentation.

- **Run `PlugInstall`:**
  After adding new plugins to your `.vimrc`, make sure to run `:PlugInstall` to install them.

- **Check for Conflicts:**
  Sometimes, other plugins or settings in your `.vimrc` might interfere with the loading of new plugins. Try commenting out other plugins or settings temporarily to isolate the issue.

By following these steps, you should be able to confirm whether your `.vimrc` is being sourced and whether `vim-polyglot` is being initialized correctly.
