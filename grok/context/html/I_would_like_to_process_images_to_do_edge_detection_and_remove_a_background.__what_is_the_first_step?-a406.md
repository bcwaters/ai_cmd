To process images for edge detection and background removal, the first step is to import the necessary libraries and load the image. Here's how you can start:

### Step 1: Import Libraries and Load the Image

For this task, we'll use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for basic image processing and OpenCV (cv2) for more advanced operations like edge detection.

```python
from PIL import Image
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
image = Image.open(image_path)
image_array = np.array(image)

# Convert the image to grayscale for edge detection
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image_array, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
```

In this step, we import the necessary libraries, load the image, convert it to a numpy array for processing, and convert it to grayscale which is typically used for edge detection.
