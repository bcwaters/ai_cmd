### What Dictates a Good Location for CMAs?

When conducting a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA), the location of the properties used as comparables (comps) is one of the most critical factors influencing the accuracy and relevance of the analysis. Here are the key aspects that dictate a good location for CMAs:

#### **1. Proximity to the Subject Property**
- **Close Distance:** The comps should be as close as possible to the subject property. Ideally, they should be within the same neighborhood or immediate vicinity. This ensures that the properties are subject to similar market conditions, amenities, and environmental factors.

#### **2. Similar Neighborhood Characteristics**
- **Demographics and Socioeconomics:** The comps should be in areas with similar demographic and socioeconomic profiles to the subject property's neighborhood. This includes factors like income levels, family size, and education levels.
- **Amenities and Services:** The presence of schools, parks, shopping centers, and public transportation can significantly affect property values. Comps should have access to similar amenities.

#### **3. Comparable Zoning and Land Use**
- **Zoning Regulations:** The zoning laws and land use regulations should be similar between the subject property and the comps. Differences in zoning can lead to significant variations in property values and uses.

#### **4. Market Trends and Conditions**
- **Local Market Trends:** The local real estate market trends, such as whether it is a buyer's or seller's market, should be similar for both the subject property and the comps. This helps in ensuring that the CMA reflects current market conditions accurately.

#### **5. Historical Sales Data**
- **Recent Transactions:** The comps should have recent sales data, typically within the last 3-6 months, to ensure that the data is relevant to current market conditions. Older data may not accurately reflect the current state of the market.

#### **6. Physical and Environmental Factors**
- **Topography and Views:** The physical characteristics of the land, such as elevation, views, and natural features, should be comparable. Properties with unique or superior views or settings may require adjustments.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Consideration of environmental factors such as flood zones, noise levels, and pollution can influence property values and should be similar between the comps and the subject property.

By carefully selecting comps based on these location criteria, real estate professionals can ensure that their CMAs provide a reliable and accurate estimate of the subject property's market value.
