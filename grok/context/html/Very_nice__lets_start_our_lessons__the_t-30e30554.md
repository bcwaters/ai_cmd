# Foundational Math Concepts

## Subject 1: Introduction to Variables and Equations

**Purpose:** To understand the concept of variables and how to solve basic equations.

**Relation to Prior Lessons:** This is the foundational lesson, introducing students to the concept of unknowns in mathematics, which is essential for all subsequent subjects.

### Detailed Lesson Plan:

#### Introduction to Variables

Variables are symbols that represent unknown values in mathematical expressions. They are often denoted by letters like \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \).

**Example:** If we have the expression \( x + 5 \), \( x \) is a variable representing an unknown number.

#### Solving Basic Equations

An equation is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. Solving an equation means finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

**Example:** Let's solve the equation \( x + 3 = 8 \).

```latex
\begin{align*}
x + 3 &= 8 \\
x + 3 - 3 &= 8 - 3 \\
x &= 5
\end{align*}
```

In this example, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate \( x \), finding that \( x = 5 \).

#### Practice Problems

1. Solve for \( y \) in the equation \( y - 4 = 7 \).

```latex
\begin{align*}
y - 4 &= 7 \\
y - 4 + 4 &= 7 + 4 \\
y &= 11
\end{align*}
```

2. Solve for \( z \) in the equation \( 2z = 10 \).

```latex
\begin{align*}
2z &= 10 \\
\frac{2z}{2} &= \frac{10}{2} \\
z &= 5
\end{align*}
```

These exercises help students understand how to manipulate equations to find the value of a variable, laying the groundwork for more complex mathematical concepts.
