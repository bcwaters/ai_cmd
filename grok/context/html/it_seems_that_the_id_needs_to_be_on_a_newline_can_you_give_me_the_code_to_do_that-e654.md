Here's the code to ensure that the `id` is placed on a new line:

# Ensuring ID on a New Line

To place the `id` on a new line, you can use the following Python code snippet. This example assumes you're working with a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains an `id` key among other keys.

```python
data = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    # ... more entries ...
]

# Function to format each dictionary with id on a new line
def format_entry(entry):
    id_line = f"id: {entry['id']}"
    other_lines = [f"{key}: {value}" for key, value in entry.items() if key != 'id']
    return id_line + "
" + "
".join(other_lines)

# Format all entries
formatted_data = [format_entry(entry) for entry in data]

# Print the formatted data
for entry in formatted_data:
    print(entry)
    print()  # Add a blank line between entries for readability
```

This code will output each entry with the `id` on its own line, followed by the other key-value pairs. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
id: 1
name: Alice
age: 30

id: 2
name: Bob
age: 25
```
