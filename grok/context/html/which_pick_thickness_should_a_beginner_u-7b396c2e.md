For a beginner strumming an acoustic guitar, a **thin to medium pick** (≤0.50mm to 0.80mm) is recommended. These picks are easier to handle, provide a forgiving sound, and are versatile enough for beginners to explore different techniques as they progress.

Here's a breakdown of why these thicknesses are suitable:

- **Thin Picks (≤0.50mm)**: Highly flexible and easy to manipulate, perfect for beginners. They produce a soft and warm tone, which is ideal for practicing strumming techniques.

- **Medium Picks (0.50mm - 0.80mm)**: Offer a balance between flexibility and rigidity, suitable for transitioning to more advanced techniques. They provide a clearer tone with a bit more attack, good for both strumming and beginning to pick individual notes.

**Recommendation for Beginners**: Start with a thin pick for the easiest learning experience, and as you become more comfortable, you can transition to a medium pick to explore different sounds and techniques.
