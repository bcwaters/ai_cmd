In the context of the Sobel Edge Detection with TinyGrad code, "order M x N" refers to the dimensions of the image being processed. Here's a detailed explanation:

- **M**: This represents the height of the image in pixels. It is the number of rows in the image matrix.
- **N**: This represents the width of the image in pixels. It is the number of columns in the image matrix.

When we talk about the computational complexity as O(M * N), we are referring to the total number of pixels in the image. The complexity is linear with respect to the total number of pixels because operations such as convolution, gradient calculation, normalization, and thresholding are applied to each pixel in the image.

### Example:
For an image of size 1024x1024 pixels:
- **M = 1024** (height)
- **N = 1024** (width)

The total number of pixels would be \( M \times N = 1024 \times 1024 = 1,048,576 \) pixels. The computational operations would be applied to each of these pixels, resulting in a total complexity of O(1,048,576), which simplifies to O(M * N).
