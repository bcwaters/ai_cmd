Yes, you can use `../` in the `href` attribute to reference a file in a parent directory. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<a href="../file.pdf" download="suggested_filename.pdf">Download File</a>
```

In this example, `../file.pdf` indicates that the file `file.pdf` is located in the directory one level above the current directory.

If you need to go up multiple levels, you can use multiple `../` segments. For example, to go up two levels:

```html
<a href="../../file.pdf" download="suggested_filename.pdf">Download File</a>
```

Remember, the `download` attribute's functionality and the ability to navigate to parent directories depend on the server's configuration and the browser's support.
