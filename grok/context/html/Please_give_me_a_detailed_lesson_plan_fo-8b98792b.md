## Subject 3: Basic Statistics and Data Analysis

**Purpose:** To introduce data collection, representation, and basic analysis techniques.

**Relation to Prior Lessons:** Using the coordinate system learned previously, students now apply it to represent data visually, expanding their understanding of how variables can represent real-world information.

### Lesson Plan for Subject 3

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to collect data, represent it using different types of graphs, and perform basic statistical analysis.

**Materials Needed:**
- Coordinate grid paper
- Markers or colored pencils
- Calculators (optional)
- Chart paper or whiteboard
- Computer or tablet with spreadsheet software (optional)

**Introduction (10 minutes):**
- Begin by revisiting the concept of coordinate geometry from the previous lesson. Ask students to recall how they plotted points on a coordinate plane.
- Explain that today they will use these skills to represent and analyze data, which is a crucial part of statistics.
- Introduce the term "data" and discuss how it can be collected from various sources (e.g., surveys, experiments, observations).

**Activity 1: Data Collection (15 minutes):**
- Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a simple data collection task. Examples might include:
  - Measuring the heights of students in the class.
  - Counting the number of books each student has read this month.
  - Surveying classmates about their favorite subjects.
- Provide each group with a data collection sheet to record their findings.

**Activity 2: Data Representation (20 minutes):**
- After collecting data, bring the class back together and discuss different ways to represent data visually. Introduce the following types of graphs:
  - Bar graphs
  - Line graphs
  - Pie charts
- Demonstrate how to plot data on a coordinate plane to create these graphs. Use the coordinate grid paper and markers to create examples on chart paper or the whiteboard.
- Allow students to work in their groups to create one type of graph using their collected data. Encourage them to use different colors to represent different data sets or categories.

**Activity 3: Basic Statistical Analysis (15 minutes):**
- Introduce basic statistical concepts such as mean, median, and mode.
- Walk through an example using the data collected by one of the groups. Calculate the mean, median, and mode together as a class.
- Have each group calculate these measures for their own data set. Provide calculators if needed.
- Discuss what these measures tell us about the data and how they can be useful in understanding trends and patterns.

**Activity 4: Real-Life Application (10 minutes):**
- Discuss real-life scenarios where data analysis is used. Examples could include:
  - Weather forecasting
  - Sports analytics
  - Market research
- Ask students to think about how the skills they've learned today could be applied in these contexts.

**Conclusion (10 minutes):**
- Recap the key points of the lesson: data collection, representation, and basic statistical analysis.
- Ask students to reflect on what they learned and how it connects to their previous lessons on variables and coordinate geometry.
- Assign homework where students will collect data from their family or friends and create a graph to represent it.

**Assessment:**
- Observe students during group activities to assess their understanding of data collection and representation.
- Collect and review the graphs created by students to evaluate their ability to apply coordinate geometry to data visualization.
- Review the homework assignment to assess their ability to independently apply the concepts learned.

**Extension Activities:**
- For students who finish early, provide more complex data sets and ask them to create multiple types of graphs.
- Encourage students to use spreadsheet software to input and analyze their data, introducing them to technology integration.

**Differentiation:**
- For students who need extra support, provide simplified data sets and step-by-step guidance on creating graphs.
- For advanced students, challenge them to calculate additional statistical measures such as range and standard deviation.

**Technology Integration:**
- If available, use computer or tablet-based spreadsheet software to demonstrate how data can be entered, graphed, and analyzed digitally.
- Encourage students to explore online resources for additional practice and understanding of statistical concepts.
