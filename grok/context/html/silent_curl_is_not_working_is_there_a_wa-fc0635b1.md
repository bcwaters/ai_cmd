If the `silent` command with `curl` is not working as expected in your Vim configuration, you can try an alternative approach using `curl` without the `silent` keyword and instead redirect the output to `/dev/null` to suppress it. Here's how you can modify the installation command for `vim-plug` in your `.vimrc` file:

```vim
if empty(glob('~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim'))
  silent execute '!curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim > /dev/null 2>&1'
  autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC
endif
```

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. **Remove `silent` from the `curl` command**:
   Instead of using `silent !curl`, we use `silent execute '!curl'`. This allows us to execute the `curl` command as a Vim command and redirect the output.

2. **Redirect output to `/dev/null`**:
   By adding `> /dev/null 2>&1` at the end of the `curl` command, we redirect both standard output and standard error to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing any output.

3. **Keep the rest of the configuration the same**:
   The `autocmd` for `PlugInstall` and the `endif` to close the conditional block remain unchanged.

This modification should help install `vim-plug` without displaying the output of the `curl` command. Make sure to save your `.vimrc` file and either source it or restart Vim to apply the changes.
