If you encounter the message "Not found. Try PlugInstall." in Vim, it typically means that the plugin you are trying to use has not been installed yet. Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:

1. **Run `:PlugInstall` Command:**
   Open Vim and run the following command to install the plugins listed in your `.vimrc` file:

   ```vim
   :PlugInstall
   ```

   This command will fetch and install all the plugins specified in your `vim-plug` configuration.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   After running `:PlugInstall`, you can use the `:PlugStatus` command to check the status of your plugins:

   ```vim
   :PlugStatus
   ```

   This will show you a list of all plugins, indicating whether they are installed or not.

3. **Restart Vim:**
   Sometimes, a restart of Vim is necessary for the changes to take effect. After installation, close and reopen Vim to ensure that the new plugins are loaded correctly.

4. **Check `.vimrc` Configuration:**
   Make sure that your `.vimrc` file is correctly configured with the `vim-plug` setup and that the `vim-polyglot` plugin is listed. Here's an example of what your `.vimrc` should look like:

   ```vim
   call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
   Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
   call plug#end()
   ```

   Ensure that there are no syntax errors in your `.vimrc` file, as these can prevent plugins from loading properly.

By following these steps, you should be able to install `vim-polyglot` and resolve the "Not found. Try PlugInstall." message. If you continue to face issues, consider checking the troubleshooting section in the previous response for further assistance.
