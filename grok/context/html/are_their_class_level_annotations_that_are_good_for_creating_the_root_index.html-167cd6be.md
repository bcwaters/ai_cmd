When creating the root `index.html` for TypeDoc documentation, class-level annotations can be particularly useful for structuring and organizing the documentation effectively. Here are some class-level annotations that are beneficial for this purpose:

### Class-Level Annotations for Root `index.html`

- **@packageDocumentation** - This annotation is used at the top of a file to indicate that the file contains documentation for an entire package. It helps in generating a comprehensive overview of the package in the root `index.html`.
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @packageDocumentation
   * @module myPackage
   */
  ```

- **@module** - Used to group classes, interfaces, and other items under a specific module. This helps in organizing the documentation and can be reflected in the root `index.html` to show the structure of your project.
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @module myModule
   */
  class MyClass {
    // Class implementation
  }
  ```

- **@category** - This annotation can be used to categorize classes or modules, which can help in creating a structured index in the root `index.html`. Categories can be used to group related classes together.
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @category Utilities
   */
  class UtilityClass {
    // Class implementation
  }
  ```

- **@public** - While not exclusively for the root `index.html`, using `@public` on classes ensures they are included in the public API documentation, which is typically what you want to highlight in the root index.
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @public
   */
  class PublicClass {
    // Class implementation
  }
  ```

- **@remarks** - Adding `@remarks` to a class can provide additional context or notes about the class, which can be useful in the root `index.html` to give users a quick overview of what the class does.
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @remarks
   * This class is used for managing user sessions.
   */
  class SessionManager {
    // Class implementation
  }
  ```

These annotations help in generating a well-structured and informative root `index.html` that effectively showcases the organization and key components of your TypeScript project.
