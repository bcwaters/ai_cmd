As of my last update, there isn't a minified version of the `marked` library that directly implements the "Copy to Clipboard" feature for code blocks. The `marked` library itself is a Markdown parser and renderer, and while it allows for customization through renderers, the specific feature you're asking about would need to be implemented by extending the renderer as shown in the provided example.

However, you can use the minified version of `marked` and then extend it with your custom renderer to include the "Copy to Clipboard" functionality. Here's how you could do it:

1. **Include the minified `marked` library**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js"></script>
```

2. **Extend the renderer and add the "Copy to Clipboard" functionality**:

```javascript
// Extend the renderer
const renderer = new marked.Renderer();
renderer.code = function(code, language) {
    const button = `<button class="copy-code" data-clipboard-text="${code}">Copy</button>`;
    return `<pre><code class="language-${language}">${code}</code>${button}</pre>`;
};

// Initialize marked with the custom renderer
marked.setOptions({ renderer });

// Include Clipboard.js
document.write('<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.8/clipboard.min.js"></script>');

// JavaScript function to handle copying
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-code');
    clipboard.on('success', function(e) {
        console.log('Code copied to clipboard!');
        e.clearSelection();
    });
    clipboard.on('error', function(e) {
        console.error('Failed to copy code:', e);
    });
});
```

This approach allows you to use the minified version of `marked` while still implementing the "Copy to Clipboard" feature.

If you're looking for a library that already includes this feature out-of-the-box, you might need to look into other Markdown renderers or plugins specifically designed for this purpose, but as of now, `marked` itself does not include this feature in its minified package.
