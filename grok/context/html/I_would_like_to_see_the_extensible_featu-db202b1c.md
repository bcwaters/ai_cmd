### Extensible Features of Marked.js

Marked.js is highly extensible, allowing developers to customize and enhance its functionality through plugins and options. Here are some of the key extensible features:

1. **Plugins**:
   Marked.js supports plugins that can modify the parsing and rendering process. You can create custom plugins to add new syntax or alter the output. Here's an example of how to create a simple plugin:

   ```javascript
   const marked = require('marked');

   // Define a plugin
   const myPlugin = {
     name: 'my-plugin',
     level: 'block', // Can be 'block' or 'inline'
     start(src) { return src.match(/^:::/)?.index; },
     tokenizer(src, tokens) {
       const rule = /^:::\s*(.*)\s*
([\s\S]+?)\s*:::/;
       const match = rule.exec(src);
       if (match) {
         const token = {
           type: 'my-plugin',
           raw: match[0],
           text: match[2].trim(),
           title: match[1]
         };
         return token;
       }
     },
     renderer(token) {
       return `<div class="my-plugin"><h3>${token.title}</h3><p>${token.text}</p></div>`;
     }
   };

   // Register the plugin
   marked.use({ extensions: [myPlugin] });

   // Use marked with the plugin
   const markdown = ':::My Custom Block
This is inside the custom block.
:::';
   const html = marked.parse(markdown);
   console.log(html);
   ```

   This plugin adds support for a custom block syntax (`:::Title
Content
:::`) and renders it as a specific HTML structure.

2. **Options**:
   Marked.js provides numerous options to configure its behavior. Some key options include:

   - **gfm**: Enable GitHub Flavored Markdown. When set to `true`, it enables features like tables, strikethrough, and autolinks.
   - **breaks**: Treat `
` in paragraphs as hard breaks.
   - **pedantic**: Conform to obscure parts of `markdown.pl` as much as possible. Don't fix any of the original markdown bugs or poor behavior.
   - **sanitize**: Sanitize the output. Ignore any HTML that has been input.
   - **smartLists**: Use smarter list behavior than the original markdown.
   - **smartypants**: Use "smart" typographic punctuation for things like quotes and dashes.

   Here's how you might use some of these options:

   ```javascript
   const marked = require('marked');

   marked.setOptions({
     gfm: true,
     breaks: true,
     smartLists: true
   });

   const markdown = "# Heading

- Item 1
- Item 2";
   const html = marked.parse(markdown);
   console.log(html);
   ```

3. **Custom Renderers**:
   You can also create custom renderers to modify how specific elements are rendered. This is useful for integrating with specific UI frameworks or for custom styling. Here's an example of a custom renderer for headings:

   ```javascript
   const marked = require('marked');

   const renderer = new marked.Renderer();

   renderer.heading = function(text, level) {
     return `<h${level} class="custom-heading">${text}</h${level}>`;
   };

   marked.setOptions({
     renderer: renderer
   });

   const markdown = "# Heading
## Subheading";
   const html = marked.parse(markdown);
   console.log(html);
   ```

These extensible features make marked.js a versatile tool for Markdown parsing and rendering, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs.
