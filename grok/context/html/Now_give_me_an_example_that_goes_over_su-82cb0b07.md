## Example for Subject 5: Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving

**Objective:** To apply logical reasoning and problem-solving skills in a scenario that integrates all previous subjects.

**Scenario:** Planning a Mini-City

**Problem Statement:** Your class is tasked with planning a mini-city for a school project. You need to decide where to place various facilities like schools, parks, and shops, considering factors such as distance, population density, and community needs.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Define Variables and Equations:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of schools, \( P \) the number of parks, and \( C \) the number of commercial spaces.
   - Use equations to ensure the total number of facilities does not exceed the available space, e.g., \( S + P + C \leq \text{Maximum Facilities} \).

2. **Use Coordinate Geometry:**
   - Plot the proposed locations of facilities on a coordinate grid.
   - Calculate distances between facilities to ensure accessibility, e.g., the distance between a school and a park should be within a reasonable range for students.

3. **Collect and Analyze Data:**
   - Conduct a classroom survey to gather data on community preferences and needs.
   - Use bar graphs or pictographs to represent this data visually.
   - Analyze the data to determine the optimal number and placement of facilities.

4. **Identify Patterns and Functions:**
   - Recognize patterns in the data, such as higher demand for parks in areas with more children.
   - Use functions to model relationships, e.g., \( \text{Number of Parks} = f(\text{Number of Children}) \).

5. **Apply Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving:**
   - Use logical reasoning to make decisions based on the data and patterns identified.
   - Solve the problem by iteratively adjusting the placement and number of facilities until an optimal solution is reached.

**Example Solution:**

- After collecting data, you find that areas with higher child populations need more parks. You decide to place \( P = 3 \) parks in these areas.
- Using coordinate geometry, you plot these parks and ensure they are within a 10-minute walk from the nearest school.
- You set up equations to balance the number of facilities, ensuring \( S = 2 \), \( P = 3 \), and \( C = 4 \) fit within the space constraints.
- You use functions to model the relationship between the number of children and the number of parks, adjusting as necessary.
- Finally, you apply logical reasoning to check if the solution meets all community needs and adjust based on feedback.

**Assessment:** Students will be assessed on their ability to integrate all subjects into solving the mini-city planning problem, their logical reasoning skills, and the effectiveness of their final plan.
