### Application of Each Example

#### Technique 1: Simple Feedforward Neural Network

**Application:** The example provided for a simple feedforward neural network using TinyGrad is typically suited for tasks like **classification** or **regression**. For instance, it can be used for classifying handwritten digits (e.g., MNIST dataset) where the input is a flattened 28x28 pixel image (784 features), and the output is one of 10 possible classes (digits 0-9). This architecture can be applied to any dataset where the input can be represented as a fixed-size vector and the output needs to be classified or predicted.

#### Technique 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Application:** The CNN example is specifically designed for **image classification** tasks. The architecture described, with convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers, is ideal for processing and classifying images. It can be used for tasks such as recognizing objects in photographs, detecting faces, or classifying medical images. The example assumes grayscale images (input channel of 1), but can be modified for color images.

#### Technique 3: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

**Application:** The RNN example is tailored for **sequence data processing**. It can be used for tasks like **time series prediction**, **natural language processing** (e.g., sentiment analysis, language translation), or **speech recognition**. The example provided is a simple RNN that processes sequences of input data and outputs a prediction based on the final state of the sequence. This is particularly useful for understanding and generating sequences of data.

#### Technique 4: Transfer Learning

**Application:** The transfer learning example demonstrates how to use a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50) for a new task, specifically **image classification** with a different set of classes. This technique is particularly useful when you have limited data for your specific task but have access to a pre-trained model on a large dataset. It can be applied to various domains, including medical imaging, satellite imagery analysis, or any image-related classification where fine-tuning on a specific dataset can improve performance.
