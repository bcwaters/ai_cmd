# TensorFlow Overview

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain. It's designed to facilitate the development and deployment of machine learning models, particularly neural networks. Here's a brief overview of TensorFlow:

## Key Features

- **Flexibility**: TensorFlow supports a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C++, and can run on various platforms, from CPUs to GPUs and TPUs.
- **Scalability**: It's designed to handle large-scale machine learning tasks, making it suitable for both research and production environments.
- **Eager Execution**: This feature allows for immediate operation evaluation, which is helpful for debugging and interactive development.
- **TensorBoard**: A suite of visualization tools to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs.
- **Keras Integration**: TensorFlow 2.0 and later versions include Keras as its high-level API, making it easier to build and train deep learning models.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use TensorFlow to create a linear regression model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Dummy data
xs = tf.range(-1.0, 1.0, 0.1)
ys = xs * 2 + 1

# Train the model
model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500, verbose=0)

# Make a prediction
print(model.predict([10.0]))
```

This example demonstrates creating a model, compiling it, training it with some dummy data, and making a prediction.

## Further Learning
