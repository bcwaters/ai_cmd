In Ubuntu, if you are referring to the `autocmd` command used in Vim, it is indeed available and functions the same way as in other Unix-like systems. The `autocmd` command is a part of Vim's scripting language and is used to execute commands automatically when certain events occur.

If you're encountering issues with `autocmd` not working, it might be due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Syntax Error**: Make sure your `autocmd` syntax is correct. Here's an example of how to use it in your `.vimrc`:
   ```vim
   autocmd BufWritePost .vimrc source %
   ```
   This command sources the `.vimrc` file whenever it is saved.

2. **Vim Version**: Ensure you are using a version of Vim that supports `autocmd`. Most modern installations of Vim on Ubuntu should support this feature.

3. **File Permissions**: Check if your `.vimrc` file has the correct permissions. You can set the correct permissions with:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 ~/.vimrc
   ```

4. **Vim Configuration**: Sometimes, other settings in your `.vimrc` might interfere with `autocmd`. Try commenting out other lines to isolate the issue.

If you are looking for an alternative to `autocmd` for sourcing your `.vimrc` file automatically, you can use the following command in your `.vimrc` to source it when Vim starts:
```vim
source ~/.vimrc
```
However, this will not provide the automatic sourcing on save that `autocmd` provides.

If you need further assistance or if you're experiencing a different issue, please provide more details about your specific situation.
