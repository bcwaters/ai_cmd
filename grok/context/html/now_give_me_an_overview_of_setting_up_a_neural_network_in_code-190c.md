### Setting Up a Neural Network in Tinygrad

Setting up a neural network in Tinygrad is straightforward due to its minimalistic design. Below is an overview of the steps involved in creating a simple neural network using Tinygrad. This example will cover a basic feedforward neural network for a binary classification task.

#### Step 1: Install Tinygrad

First, you need to install Tinygrad. You can do this via pip:

```bash
pip install tinygrad
```

#### Step 2: Import Necessary Modules

In your Python script, import the required modules from Tinygrad:

```python
from tinygrad.tensor import Tensor
from tinygrad.nn import optim
```

#### Step 3: Define the Neural Network Architecture

Define the structure of your neural network. For a simple feedforward network, you can use the following code:

```python
class SimpleNN:
    def __init__(self):
        self.l1 = Tensor.uniform(784, 128)  # Input layer to hidden layer
        self.l2 = Tensor.uniform(128, 10)   # Hidden layer to output layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.dot(self.l1).relu()
        x = x.dot(self.l2).log_softmax()
        return x
```

This example defines a network with an input layer of 784 neurons (for MNIST dataset), a hidden layer of 128 neurons, and an output layer of 10 neurons.

#### Step 4: Initialize the Model and Optimizer

Initialize your model and the optimizer:

```python
model = SimpleNN()
optimizer = optim.SGD([model.l1, model.l2], lr=0.01)
```

#### Step 5: Prepare the Data

For this example, we'll assume you have your data prepared as tensors. Here's a simple example of how you might load data:

```python
# Example data preparation
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
X = Tensor(np.random.rand(100, 784))
y = Tensor(np.random.randint(0, 10, (100,)))
```

#### Step 6: Train the Model

Train your model using a simple training loop:

```python
for epoch in range(100):
    # Forward pass
    out = model.forward(X)
    loss = out.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y)

    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()

    # Update weights
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

#### Step 7: Evaluate the Model

After training, you can evaluate your model on a test set:

```python
# Dummy test data
X_test = Tensor(np.random.rand(20, 784))
y_test = Tensor(np.random.randint(0, 10, (20,)))

# Evaluate
test_out = model.forward(X_test)
test_loss = test_out.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y_test)
print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss.numpy()}")
```

This overview should give you a basic understanding of how to set up and train a neural network using Tinygrad. Remember, Tinygrad's simplicity is its strength, making it ideal for educational purposes and quick prototyping.
