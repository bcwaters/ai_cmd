To generate a minified version of `marked-highlight.js` from the package you've installed, you can use a JavaScript minification tool. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Using a Minification Tool

1. **Install a Minification Tool:**
   You can use tools like `uglify-js` or `terser` to minify your JavaScript files. For this example, we'll use `uglify-js`.

   ```bash
   npm install uglify-js -g
   ```

2. **Locate the Source File:**
   Find the non-minified version of `marked-highlight.js` in your `node_modules` directory. It's usually located at:

   ```
   node_modules/marked-highlight/dist/marked-highlight.js
   ```

3. **Minify the File:**
   Use `uglify-js` to minify the file. You can do this with the following command:

   ```bash
   uglifyjs node_modules/marked-highlight/dist/marked-highlight.js -o marked-highlight.min.js
   ```

   This command will create a new file named `marked-highlight.min.js` in your current directory, which contains the minified version of the script.

4. **Verify the Minified File:**
   Open `marked-highlight.min.js` to ensure it has been minified correctly. You should see a much smaller, compressed version of the original code.

### Alternative: Using a Build Script

If `marked-highlight` comes with a build script, you might be able to use it to generate a minified version. Check the package's documentation or the `package.json` file for any build scripts:

1. **Check `package.json`:**
   Look for a `scripts` section in `package.json`. There might be a command like `build` or `minify`.

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "some-build-command"
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Build Script:**
   If you find a relevant script, you can run it using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This should generate a minified version of the script in a designated output directory.

### Considerations

- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to minify and distribute the code, as it may be subject to the package's license.
- **Updates:** If you update the package, you'll need to re-minify the latest version.
