### Subject 5: Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving

**Purpose:** To enhance logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

**Relation to Prior Lessons:** This final subject ties together all previous lessons, requiring students to apply their knowledge of variables, coordinates, data analysis, and patterns to solve complex problems, preparing them for the analytical thinking required in linear algebra and deep learning.

**Detailed Content:**

1. **Understanding Logical Sequences:**
   Students will learn to identify and construct logical sequences. For example, they will be asked to determine the next number in a sequence such as:
   ```
   2, 4, 6, 8, ...
   ```
   The next number would be 10, as the sequence follows the rule of adding 2 to the previous number.

2. **Solving Word Problems:**
   Students will practice translating real-world scenarios into mathematical problems and solving them. An example problem might be:
   > "If John has 3 apples and Mary gives him 2 more, how many apples does John have now?"
   The solution involves simple addition:
   ```
   3 + 2 = 5
   ```
   John now has 5 apples.

3. **Using Variables in Problem Solving:**
   Students will use variables to represent unknown quantities in problems. For instance:
   > "If \( x \) represents the number of apples John has, and he receives 2 more apples, the new total can be represented as \( x + 2 \)."

4. **Applying Coordinate Geometry:**
   Problems may require students to use coordinate geometry to visualize and solve problems. For example:
   > "Plot the points (2, 3) and (5, 7) on a coordinate plane and calculate the distance between them."
   The distance can be calculated using the distance formula:
   ```
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   ```
   Substituting the values:
   ```
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
   ```

5. **Data Analysis in Problem Solving:**
   Students will apply data analysis techniques learned in Subject 3 to solve problems. For example:
   > "Given a set of test scores: 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, calculate the mean score."
   The mean is calculated as:
   ```
   \text{Mean} = \frac{70 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95}{5} = \frac{420}{5} = 84
   ```

6. **Pattern Recognition and Functions:**
   Students will use pattern recognition and functions to solve problems. For example:
   > "Identify the pattern in the sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, ... and find the next number."
   The sequence represents the squares of consecutive integers:
   ```
   1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, ...
   ```
   The next number is \( 5^2 = 25 \).

**Assessment:**
Students will be assessed through a combination of quizzes, problem-solving tasks, and projects that require them to apply all the concepts learned throughout the syllabus. The assessment will focus on their ability to integrate knowledge from all subjects to solve complex, multi-step problems.
