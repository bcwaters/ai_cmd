### Characteristics of Pick Thicknesses on Guitar

When choosing a guitar pick, the thickness can significantly affect your playing experience and sound. Here are the main characteristics associated with different pick thicknesses:

- **Sound**: Provides a clear tone with a moderate attack, versatile for both strumming and picking.
- **Technique**: Good for both rhythm and lead playing, widely used in rock and pop music.

#### Heavy Picks (≥0.80mm)
- **Rigidity**: Less flexible, providing more control and precision.
- **Sound**: Produces a sharper, more defined tone with a strong attack, ideal for lead playing.
- **Technique**: Preferred by players who focus on intricate picking patterns, commonly used in genres like metal and jazz.

#### Extra Heavy Picks (≥1.50mm)
- **Durability**: Very durable and resistant to wear.
