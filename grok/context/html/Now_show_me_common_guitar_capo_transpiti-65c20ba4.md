### Tips for Using a Capo
- **Experiment with Different Positions**: Capos can help you find new sounds and make songs easier to sing in a different key.
- **Check Tuning**: After placing a capo, ensure your guitar is still in tune as the capo can affect the pitch of the strings.
- **Practice Transitions**: Practice moving the capo quickly between songs to improve your performance flow.
