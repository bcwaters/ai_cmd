Highlight.js is primarily a syntax highlighting library designed to enhance the readability of code snippets within HTML pages. It is not inherently designed to function as a standalone README previewer. However, it can be integrated into a larger system or tool that renders README files, particularly those containing code blocks, to provide syntax highlighting for those code snippets.

If you want to create a README previewer that utilizes Highlight.js, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Parse the README File**: Use a Markdown parser to convert the Markdown content of the README into HTML. Libraries like `marked` or `showdown` can be used for this purpose.

2. **Integrate Highlight.js**: Once the Markdown is converted to HTML, you can apply Highlight.js to the `<code>` elements within the `<pre>` tags to highlight the code blocks. This would involve including the Highlight.js library in your HTML and calling `hljs.highlightAll()` after the DOM is loaded.

3. **Display the Result**: Render the resulting HTML in a web page or a dedicated preview pane within your application.

Here's a simple example of how this might look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>README Previewer</title>
    <script src="path/to/marked.min.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/highlight.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/styles/default.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="readme-content"></div>
    <script>
        const markdown = `# Example README
\`\`\`javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
\`\`\`
`;
        document.getElementById('readme-content').innerHTML = marked.parse(markdown);
        hljs.highlightAll();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this setup, Highlight.js enhances the readability of code within the README, but it doesn't handle the parsing of Markdown or the overall structure of the README previewer. For a full-fledged README previewer, you would need additional components to handle file loading, navigation, and other features typical of such tools.
