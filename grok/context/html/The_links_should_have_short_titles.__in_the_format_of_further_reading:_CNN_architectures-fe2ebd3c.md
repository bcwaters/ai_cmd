#### Technique 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Application:** The CNN example is specifically designed for **image classification** tasks. The architecture described, with convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers, is ideal for processing and classifying images. It can be used for tasks such as recognizing objects in photographs, detecting faces, or classifying medical images. The example assumes grayscale images (input channel of 1), but can be modified for color images.

**Code:**

```python
import tinygrad as tg

# Define the CNN architecture
class SimpleCNN(tg.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = tg.nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = tg.nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.pool = tg.nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.fc1 = tg.nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 128)
        self.fc2 = tg.nn.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(tg.nn.functional.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(tg.nn.functional.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 7 * 7)
        x = tg.nn.functional.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleCNN()
loss_fn = tg.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = tg.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop (example for one epoch)
for xb, yb in train_loader:
    pred = model(xb)
    loss = loss_fn(pred, yb)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

**Enhancements and Improvements:**

To further improve the CNN model, consider implementing batch normalization to stabilize the learning process and reduce the sensitivity to the initial random weights. You might also explore using residual connections or experimenting with different architectures like VGG or Inception to potentially achieve better performance.
