For a React application, one of the preferred TypeScript documentation libraries is **TypeDoc**. TypeDoc is a documentation generator for TypeScript projects, which can be seamlessly integrated with React applications. It generates API documentation from TypeScript source code, making it easier to maintain and understand your project's codebase.

Here's a simple example of how to set up TypeDoc in your React project:

1. **Install TypeDoc**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typedoc
   ```

2. **Configure TypeDoc**:
   Create a `typedoc.json` file in your project root with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "entryPoints": ["src/index.ts"],
     "out": "docs"
   }
   ```

3. **Add a script to package.json**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "docs": "typedoc"
   }
   ```

4. **Generate Documentation**:
   Run the following command to generate the documentation:
   ```bash
   npm run docs
   ```

TypeDoc is particularly useful because it supports JSX, which is commonly used in React, and it can be customized to fit your project's needs.
