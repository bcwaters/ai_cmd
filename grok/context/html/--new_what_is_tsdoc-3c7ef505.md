### What is TSDoc?

TSDoc is a documentation specification for TypeScript. It extends the standard JSDoc tags and syntax to provide more detailed and structured documentation for TypeScript projects. TSDoc allows developers to document their code in a way that can be easily understood and utilized by other developers and tools.

#### Key Features of TSDoc:
- **Extended Tags:** TSDoc introduces additional tags that are specific to TypeScript, such as `@typeParam`, `@override`, and `@sealed`.
- **Better Type Documentation:** It provides more precise ways to document types, interfaces, and generics.
- **Integration with Tools:** TSDoc is designed to work well with TypeScript-aware tools, such as API extractors and documentation generators.
- **Improved Readability:** The syntax is designed to be clear and concise, making it easier for developers to write and read documentation.

#### Example of TSDoc:
```typescript
/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 * @param a - The first number to add.
 * @param b - The second number to add.
 * @returns The sum of `a` and `b`.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * add(2, 3); // Returns 5
 * ```
 */
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

TSDoc is particularly useful in large projects where maintaining clear and accurate documentation is crucial for team collaboration and project maintainability.
