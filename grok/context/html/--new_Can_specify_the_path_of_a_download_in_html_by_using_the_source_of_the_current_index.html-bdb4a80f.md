To specify the path of a download in HTML, you can use the `download` attribute on an anchor (`<a>`) tag. The `download` attribute allows you to specify a filename for the downloaded file, and you can use relative or absolute paths to point to the file you want to download. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<a href="path/to/your/file.pdf" download="suggested_filename.pdf">Download File</a>
```

In this example, `path/to/your/file.pdf` is the path to the file you want to download, and `suggested_filename.pdf` is the suggested filename for the downloaded file.

If you want to use the source of the current `index.html` as a reference point, you can use relative paths. For example, if your file is in the same directory as your `index.html`, you can simply use the filename:

```html
<a href="file.pdf" download="suggested_filename.pdf">Download File</a>
```

If the file is in a subdirectory, you can use a relative path like this:

```html
<a href="downloads/file.pdf" download="suggested_filename.pdf">Download File</a>
```

Remember, the `download` attribute is not supported in all browsers, so it's good to test your implementation across different browsers.

Follow-up questions you might have:
1. How can I ensure the download attribute works in all browsers?
2. Can I use the `download` attribute with other types of files besides PDF?
3. What are the security implications of using the `download` attribute?
