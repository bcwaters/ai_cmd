TensorFlow.js is designed to be compatible with modern JavaScript environments. It primarily uses ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features and is compatible with later versions of JavaScript as well. This means it can run in environments that support ES6+ syntax, which includes most modern browsers and Node.js environments.

To ensure compatibility with a wide range of environments, TensorFlow.js also provides polyfills and transpilation options for older environments that may not support all ES6 features natively.

Here's a simple example of how you might check the JavaScript version compatibility in a TensorFlow.js project:

```javascript
// Check if the environment supports ES6 features
if (typeof Symbol === 'function' && typeof Symbol.iterator === 'symbol') {
  console.log('ES6 is supported');
} else {
  console.log('ES6 is not supported, consider using polyfills');
}

// Import TensorFlow.js
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Use TensorFlow.js
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));
```

This code snippet checks for the presence of the `Symbol` type, which is an ES6 feature, and then proceeds to use TensorFlow.js.
