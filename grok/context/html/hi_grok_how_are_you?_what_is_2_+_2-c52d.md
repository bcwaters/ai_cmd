Hi there! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. 

2 + 2 equals 4.

Here's a simple Python function to calculate 2 + 2:

```python
def calculate_two_plus_two():
    """
    Calculates the sum of 2 and 2.
    
    Returns:
    int: The result of 2 + 2
    """
    result = 2 + 2
    return result

# Example usage
print(calculate_two_plus_two())  # Output: 4
```

This function demonstrates a basic arithmetic operation and includes a descriptive docstring. The example usage shows how to call the function and print the result.
