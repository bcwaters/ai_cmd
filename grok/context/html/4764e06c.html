  <div id="content"><p>Here is an extended list of TensorFlow.js models with a brief summary for each:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>MobileNet</strong></h3>
<p>MobileNet is a lightweight deep neural network ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications, primarily used for image classification.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>COCO-SSD</strong></h3>
<p>COCO-SSD is a real-time object detection model trained on the COCO dataset, capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within an image.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>PoseNet</strong></h3>
<p>PoseNet estimates human poses in real-time from images or video, suitable for applications like fitness tracking or interactive games.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>FaceLandmark68Net</strong></h3>
<p>This model detects and landmarks 68 points on a human face, which is useful for facial recognition and analysis.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>BodyPix</strong></h3>
<p>BodyPix is used for person segmentation, enabling effects like background removal or virtual try-on experiences.</p>
<h3>6. <strong>BlazeFace</strong></h3>
<p>BlazeFace is a lightweight face detection model designed for mobile devices, offering fast and accurate face detection.</p>
<h3>7. <strong>KNN Classifier</strong></h3>
<p>The KNN Classifier allows you to create a custom classifier using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which can be trained on the fly in the browser.</p>
<h3>8. <strong>Toxicity</strong></h3>
<p>The Toxicity model detects toxic language in text, useful for moderating online content and creating safer online environments.</p>
<h3>9. <strong>Universal Sentence Encoder</strong></h3>
<p>This model encodes text into high-dimensional vectors that can be used for semantic similarity, text classification, and other natural language processing tasks.</p>
<h3>10. <strong>Speech Commands</strong></h3>
<p>The Speech Commands model recognizes a set of predefined voice commands, making it suitable for voice-controlled applications.</p>
<h3>11. <strong>DeepLab</strong></h3>
<p>DeepLab is a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model that can be used to label each pixel in an image with a class, useful for image editing and analysis.</p>
<h3>12. <strong>BERT</strong></h3>
<p>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful model for natural language understanding, capable of performing tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis.</p>
<h3>13. <strong>HandPose</strong></h3>
<p>HandPose detects and estimates the pose of hands in real-time, which can be used for gesture recognition and interactive applications.</p>
<h3>14. <strong>FaceMesh</strong></h3>
<p>FaceMesh provides a detailed mesh of the face, including 468 3D facial landmarks, which can be used for advanced facial analysis and AR applications.</p>
<h3>15. <strong>Objectron</strong></h3>
<p>Objectron is a model for 3D object detection and tracking, which can be used to understand the spatial arrangement of objects in a scene.</p>
<p>These models cover a wide range of applications from vision and audio processing to natural language understanding, making TensorFlow.js a versatile tool for developing machine learning applications in the browser.</p>
