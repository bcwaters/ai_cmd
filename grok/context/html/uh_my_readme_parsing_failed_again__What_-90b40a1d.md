Here's the analysis of the characters in the string before "Option 2" in the README that could potentially cause parsing issues with `marked.js`:

### Characters Before Option 2

The text before "Option 2" contains the following characters that might cause issues:

1. **Non-ASCII Characters**: The text uses standard ASCII characters, so there are no non-ASCII characters that could cause issues.

2. **Special Characters**: 
   - `<` and `>`: These are used in HTML tags (`<script>`). If not properly escaped in Markdown, they might be interpreted as HTML tags, potentially causing parsing issues.
   - `"` and `'`: These are used in the `src` attribute of the script tag. If not properly handled, they could interfere with Markdown parsing.

3. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: 
   - The text includes line breaks (`
`) which are generally handled well by Markdown parsers. However, inconsistent line breaks or extra whitespace might cause issues if the parser is not robust.

4. **Backslashes (`\`):** 
   - There are no backslashes in the text before "Option 2", so this is not a concern here.

5. **Markdown Syntax**: 
   - The text uses proper Markdown syntax for headers (`###`, `####`), code blocks (```), and lists (`1.`, `-`). However, if the parser is sensitive to the exact formatting, slight deviations could cause issues.

### Example of the Text Before Option 2

Here is the text before "Option 2" for reference:

To set up TensorFlow.js in the browser, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Include TensorFlow.js in Your Project

You have two main options to include TensorFlow.js in your project:

#### Option 1: Using a CDN

You can directly link to the TensorFlow.js script from a CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@latest/dist/tf.min.js"></script>
```
```

### Recommendations for Debugging

- **Check HTML Tag Handling**: Ensure that `marked.js` is correctly handling the HTML tags within the Markdown. You might need to escape these tags or use a different parser configuration.
- **Whitespace and Line Breaks**: Verify that the parser is correctly handling line breaks and whitespace. If possible, try normalizing the text before parsing.
- **Markdown Syntax Validation**: Double-check that the Markdown syntax used is correct and consistent. Sometimes, slight deviations can cause issues with certain parsers.

By examining these elements, you should be able to identify and resolve the parsing issues with `marked.js`.
