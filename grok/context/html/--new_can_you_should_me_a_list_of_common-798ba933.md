Here is a list of common characters that you might want to remove when copy-pasting a string, especially if you're dealing with text that might have been formatted or come from a web source:

- `
` (newline)
- `\r` (carriage return)
- `\t` (tab)
- `&nbsp;` (non-breaking space)
- `&amp;` (ampersand)
- `&lt;` (less than)
- `&gt;` (greater than)
- `&#39;` (single quote)
- `&quot;` (double quote)
- `&#160;` (another non-breaking space)

These characters can often disrupt the flow of text or cause issues in programming and data processing tasks.

Would you like to know more about how to remove these characters programmatically? Or are there specific scenarios where you encounter these issues?
