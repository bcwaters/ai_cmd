The gradient magnitude is calculated and returned in the Sobel edge detection process for several important reasons:

### Why Calculate and Return the Gradient Magnitude?

1. **Edge Strength Representation**:
   The gradient magnitude represents the strength or intensity of the edges in the image. By calculating the square root of the sum of the squared gradients in the x and y directions (i.e., `gx**2 + gy**2`), we obtain a measure of how strong the edge is at each pixel. This is crucial for identifying and quantifying edges.

2. **Visualization and Further Processing**:
   Returning the gradient magnitude allows for visualization of the edge map. In the provided code, `plt.imshow(edge_image, cmap='gray')` uses this magnitude to display the edges. Additionally, the magnitude can be used for further image processing tasks, such as thresholding for segmentation, as shown in the `simple_segmentation` function.

3. **Edge Detection**:
   The gradient magnitude is a key component in edge detection algorithms. It helps in distinguishing between edges and non-edges. Strong edges will have higher magnitude values, making them stand out in the resulting image.

4. **Thresholding for Segmentation**:
   The magnitude is essential for the thresholding step in segmentation. By comparing the magnitude to a threshold value, we can classify pixels as part of an edge or not, which is the basis for the segmentation in the `simple_segmentation` function.

In summary, calculating and returning the gradient magnitude is fundamental for both visualizing the edges in an image and for subsequent image processing steps like segmentation.
