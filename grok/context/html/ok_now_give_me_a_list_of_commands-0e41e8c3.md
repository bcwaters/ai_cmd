Here is a list of essential Vim commands for editing and navigation:

- **Deleting a word:** Use `dw` to delete the word under or after the cursor. This is useful for quickly removing unwanted text.
- **Jumping to a specific line:** Type `:{num}gg` or `:{num}G` to navigate directly to line number `{num}`. This command is essential for efficiently moving around large files.
- **Inserting text:** Press `i` to enter insert mode, allowing you to type new text at the cursor's position.
- **Deleting a line:** Use `dd` to delete the entire line where the cursor is located.
- **Copying a line:** Use `yy` to yank (copy) the current line into the Vim register.
- **Pasting text:** Use `p` to paste the contents of the Vim register after the cursor, or `P` to paste before the cursor.
- **Undoing an action:** Press `u` to undo the last change. This is crucial for correcting mistakes.
- **Redoing an action:** Use `Ctrl + r` to redo the last undone action.

These commands form the foundation of efficient text editing and navigation in Vim.
