  <div id="content"><pre><code class="language-markdown"># Firm Legal Guidance for Arizona Eviction Process

To navigate the eviction process firmly yet non-confrontationally, follow these steps:

1. **Preparation**: Ensure you have all documentation ready, including the lease agreement, the bounced check, and any prior correspondence with the tenant. This preparation will help you stay organized and professional.

2. **Initial Contact**: Schedule a meeting with the tenant. Start the conversation by stating the purpose clearly and calmly, e.g., &quot;I need to discuss the bounced check and the unauthorized resident living in the property.&quot;

3. **Discuss Issues**: Address the bounced check first. Explain that the rent payment was not honored and ask if there was an error or if they can make immediate payment. For the unauthorized resident, mention that they are not on the lease and their presence violates the agreement.

4. **Offer Resolution**: Give the tenant an opportunity to resolve the issues. You might say, &quot;You have five days to remedy these issues or vacate the premises. If you fail to comply, I will proceed with filing an eviction lawsuit.&quot;

5. **Serve Eviction Notice**: If the tenant does not comply within the five-day period, serve them with a formal eviction notice. The notice should clearly state the reasons for eviction and the timeframe for response.

6. **Legal Action**: If the tenant does not remedy the situation after receiving the eviction notice, file an eviction lawsuit. Understand that this process can take several weeks before the tenant is legally removed from the property.

7. **Maintain Professionalism**: Throughout the process, maintain a professional demeanor. This is not only legally required but also helps in ensuring a smooth eviction process.

8. **Follow-Up**: After serving the eviction notice, follow up with the tenant to see if they have taken any steps to remedy the situation. This follow-up can be a phone call or a written communication.

9. **Support Systems**: Be aware of local resources that can assist tenants in difficult situations, such as housing assistance programs. While this is not your responsibility, being informed can facilitate a more humane process.

10. **Final Communication**: If the tenant still does not comply, communicate the next steps clearly. You might say, &quot;As you have not complied with the eviction notice, I am proceeding with the eviction lawsuit. You will be legally required to vacate the premises once the court rules in my favor.&quot;

**Disclaimer**: In Arizona, the eviction process cannot be completed within a week. After serving the eviction notice, the tenant has five days to respond. If they do not comply, you must file an eviction lawsuit, which can take several weeks to resolve before the tenant is legally removed from the property.

When serving the eviction notice, you might say:

&quot;Hello [Tenant&#39;s Name], I am serving you with an eviction notice due to the bounced check for rent and the unauthorized resident living in the property. You have five days to remedy these issues or vacate the premises. Please understand that this is a formal legal process, and I am obligated to follow through if the situation is not resolved. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you.&quot;
