To add a "Copy to Clipboard" button for code blocks in a README file using the `marked` library, you can modify the renderer to include a button that triggers a JavaScript function to copy the code to the clipboard. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Modify the Renderer**: Extend the `marked` renderer to add a button to each code block.

2. **JavaScript Function**: Create a JavaScript function to handle the copying of the code to the clipboard.

Here's a sample implementation:

```javascript
// Extend the renderer
const renderer = new marked.Renderer();
renderer.code = function(code, language) {
    // Create a button
    const button = `<button class="copy-code" data-clipboard-text="${code}">Copy</button>`;
    // Return the modified code block with the button
    return `<pre><code class="language-${language}">${code}</code>${button}</pre>`;
};

// Initialize marked with the custom renderer
marked.setOptions({ renderer });

// JavaScript function to handle copying
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-code');
    clipboard.on('success', function(e) {
        console.log('Code copied to clipboard!');
        e.clearSelection();
    });
    clipboard.on('error', function(e) {
        console.error('Failed to copy code:', e);
    });
});
```

You will also need to include the Clipboard.js library in your project. You can add it via a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.8/clipboard.min.js"></script>
```

**Note**: This solution assumes you are working in an environment where you can add JavaScript to your page. If you are using a static site generator or a platform like GitHub, you might need to look into their specific solutions or plugins for adding custom functionality.

After implementing this, you might want to consider the following follow-up questions:

1. How can I style the copy button to match my site's theme?
2. Is there a way to show a success message after the code is copied?
3. Can this solution be adapted for other types of content, like text blocks?
