Here's an analysis of the computational cost for each edge detection strategy mentioned. The computational cost is generally assessed based on the number of operations required, including convolution operations, arithmetic operations, and any additional processing steps. Note that these costs are relative and can vary based on implementation details and hardware.

### 1. **Sobel Edge Detection**

**Computational Cost:**
- **Convolution:** Two 3x3 convolutions (horizontal and vertical).
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Squaring and square root operations for combining results.
- **Total Cost:** Moderate. The cost primarily comes from the two convolutions, which are relatively inexpensive but still significant.

```python
# Sobel Example
sobelx = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=5)
sobely = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=5)
sobel = np.sqrt(sobelx**2 + sobely**2)
```

### 2. **Canny Edge Detection**

**Computational Cost:**
- **Gaussian Blur:** One convolution with a Gaussian kernel.
- **Sobel Edge Detection:** Two convolutions (as described above).
- **Non-maximum Suppression:** Additional operations to thin edges.
- **Double Thresholding and Edge Tracking:** More operations to connect edges.
- **Total Cost:** High. Canny is computationally more expensive due to multiple stages of processing.

```python
# Canny Example
edges = cv2.Canny(image, 100, 200)
```

### 3. **Prewitt Edge Detection**

**Computational Cost:**
- **Convolution:** Two 3x3 convolutions (horizontal and vertical).
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Squaring and square root operations for combining results.
- **Total Cost:** Moderate. Similar to Sobel but with slightly different kernels.

```python
# Prewitt Example
gx = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, prewittx)
gy = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, prewitty)
prewitt = np.sqrt(gx**2 + gy**2)
```

### 4. **Roberts Edge Detection**

**Computational Cost:**
- **Convolution:** Two 2x2 convolutions (horizontal and vertical).
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Squaring and square root operations for combining results.
- **Total Cost:** Low. The smallest kernel size results in the least computational cost among the convolution-based methods.

```python
# Roberts Example
gx = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, robertsx)
gy = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, robertsy)
roberts = np.sqrt(gx**2 + gy**2)
```

### 5. **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) Edge Detection**

**Computational Cost:**
- **Gaussian Blur:** One convolution with a Gaussian kernel.
- **Laplacian:** One convolution with a Laplacian kernel.
- **Total Cost:** Moderate to High. The Gaussian blur adds to the computational cost, but it's less than Canny.

```python
# LoG Example
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (3, 3), 0)
laplacian = cv2.Laplacian(blurred, cv2.CV_64F)
```

### 6. **Difference of Gaussians (DoG) Edge Detection**

**Computational Cost:**
- **Gaussian Blur:** Two convolutions with Gaussian kernels of different sizes.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Subtraction of the two blurred images.
- **Total Cost:** Moderate. The cost is primarily from the two Gaussian convolutions.

```python
# DoG Example
gaussian1 = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (0, 0), 1)
gaussian2 = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (0, 0), 2)
dog = gaussian1 - gaussian2
```

### Summary

- **Lowest Cost:** Roberts (due to the smallest kernel size).
- **Moderate Cost:** Sobel, Prewitt, LoG, DoG (all involve similar convolution operations).
- **Highest Cost:** Canny (due to multiple stages of processing).

The choice of method depends on the balance between computational resources and the desired quality of edge detection.
