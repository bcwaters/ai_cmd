# README: Flood Fill Oval Interior Script

## Overview

This Python script uses the **Pillow** library to perform a flood fill operation specifically designed to fill the interior of an oval shape in an image, respecting any transparent areas. The script automatically detects a starting point for the flood fill and ensures that only the solid interior of the oval is filled. **Pillow** is essential because it provides the image processing capabilities required for opening, manipulating, and saving images in various formats, including the flood fill functionality used in this script.

## Features

- **Automatic Starting Point Detection**: Searches for the first non-transparent pixel from the top of the image.
- **Interior Filling Only**: Ensures that only the interior of the oval is filled, stopping at transparent areas.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback if no non-transparent pixels are found.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- **Pillow (PIL) library**: Required for image processing operations such as opening images, manipulating pixel data, and performing flood fill operations.

## Setup Environment with `uv`

To set up your environment using `uv`, follow these steps:

1. **Install `uv`**:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     .venv\\Scripts\\activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install Pillow
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place your input image** in the same directory as the script or provide the full path.
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python flood_fill_oval_interior.py input_image.png output_filled_image.png
   ```

## Code

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

def flood_fill_oval_interior(image_path, output_path):
    # Open the image and keep it in RGBA mode
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGBA')
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)

    # Get the image dimensions
    width, height = image.size

    # Function to find the first non-transparent pixel from the top
    def find_top_edge():
        for y in range(height):
            for x in range(width):
                if image.getpixel((x, y))[3] > 0:  # Alpha channel value
                    return x, y
        return None  # If no non-transparent pixel found

    # Find the top edge of the oval
    start_point = find_top_edge()
    if start_point is None:
        print("No non-transparent pixels found in the image.")
        return

    # Flood fill using the alpha channel, starting from the top edge
    draw.floodfill(start_point, (255, 255, 255, 255), thresh=50)

    # Save the result
    image.save(output_path)

# Example usage
flood_fill_oval_interior('input_image.png', 'output_filled_image.png')
```

## Considerations

- The script assumes the oval has a solid, non-transparent top edge. Adjust `find_top_edge` if needed.
- The `thresh` parameter in `floodfill` may need adjustment based on image transparency.
- For images with multiple ovals or complex shapes, multiple `floodfill` calls might be necessary.
