# Sobel Edge Detection and Image Segmentation with TinyGrad

This project implements Sobel Edge Detection and basic image segmentation using the TinyGrad framework. Below is a detailed guide on the code, its functionality, and how to use it.

## Overview

The code provides a benchmark for processing images using Sobel Edge Detection and offers a foundation for image segmentation. It leverages TinyGrad for efficient tensor operations and edge detection.

## Key Features

- **Sobel Edge Detection**: Uses convolution to detect edges in images.
- **Image Segmentation**: Basic segmentation based on edge strength, suitable for further development into more advanced segmentation techniques.
- **Benchmarking**: Measures the performance of image processing on your hardware.
- **Command-line Interface**: Utilizes `argparse` for flexible usage.

## Code Structure

### Main Functions

1. **`process_image(image_path)`**:
   - Loads an image using TinyGrad.
   - Applies Sobel Edge Detection.
   - Returns the processed image.

2. **`benchmark(num_images, image_path)`**:
   - Measures the time taken to process a specified number of images.
   - Outputs performance metrics in images per second and per minute.

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py --num_images 100 --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your Python script and `/path/to/image.jpg` with the path to your input image.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TinyGrad
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

### Example Output

```
Processed 100 images in 10.50 seconds
Images per second: 9.52
Images per minute: 571.20
```

## Further Development

- **Advanced Segmentation**: Implement more sophisticated segmentation techniques like region growing or watershed segmentation.
- **Noise Reduction**: Add pre-processing steps to enhance edge detection.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Improve edge detection with adaptive thresholding methods.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib to visualize edge maps and segmentation results.

## Computational Complexity

The computational complexity for Sobel Edge Detection is O(M * N), where M and N are the dimensions of the image in pixels. This complexity applies to each image processed.
