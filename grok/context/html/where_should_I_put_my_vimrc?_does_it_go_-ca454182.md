The `.vimrc` file should be placed in your home directory, which is denoted by `~/`. Here's how you can create and source your `.vimrc` file:

### Creating and Sourcing `.vimrc`

1. **Create the `.vimrc` file:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new `.vimrc` file in your home directory:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.vimrc
   ```

2. **Edit the `.vimrc` file:**
   You can use any text editor to add your custom settings to the `.vimrc` file. For example, you can use Vim itself:
   ```bash
   vim ~/.vimrc
   ```

3. **Source the `.vimrc` file:**
   To apply the settings in your `.vimrc` file, you need to source it. You can do this within Vim by running the following command:
   ```vim
   :source ~/.vimrc
   ```
   Alternatively, you can add this command to your `.vimrc` file to automatically source it whenever you start Vim:
   ```vim
   autocmd VimEnter * source ~/.vimrc
   ```

### Vim Plugin Installation Using vim-plug

If you want to enhance Vim with plugins, you can use a plugin manager like `vim-plug`. Here's how to set it up in your `.vimrc`:

1. **Install vim-plug:**
   Run the following command to download and install `vim-plug`:
   ```bash
   curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
   ```

2. **Configure Plugins in `.vimrc`:**
   Add the following to your `.vimrc` to set up and install plugins:
   ```vim
   call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
   Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
   Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
   Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
   Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
   Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
   Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
   Plug 'easymotion/vim-easymotion'
   Plug 'christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator'
   Plug 'honza/vim-snippets'
   call plug#end()

   " Install plugins on Vim startup
   autocmd VimEnter * if len(filter(values(g:plugs), '!isdirectory(v:val.dir)')) | PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC | endif
   ```

3. **Install Plugins:**
   When you start Vim, it will automatically install the plugins if they are not already installed. You can also manually install them by running:
   ```vim
   :PlugInstall
   ```

### Example `.vimrc` Configuration

Here's a sample `.vimrc` file that includes basic settings and the plugin configuration:

```vim
" Basic Settings
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
set number
set relativenumber

" Plugin Configuration
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
Plug 'easymotion/vim-easymotion'
Plug 'christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator'
Plug 'honza/vim-snippets'
call plug#end()

" Custom Keybindings
nnoremap <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

" Automatically source .vimrc on save
autocmd BufWritePost .vimrc source %
```

This configuration sets up basic tab settings, enables line numbers, and installs several useful plugins to enhance your Vim experience.
