To use the `ImageDraw.Draw` function from the Pillow library, you can create a drawing context on an image. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# Open the image and convert it to RGBA mode
image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGBA')

# Create a drawing context
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)

# Now you can use 'draw' to perform drawing operations on the image
# For example, to draw a red line from (0, 0) to (100, 100):
# draw.line((0, 0, 100, 100), fill='red', width=2)
```

This code snippet shows how to create a drawing context on an image that has been converted to RGBA mode. With the `draw` object, you can perform various drawing operations like drawing lines, shapes, and text on the image.
