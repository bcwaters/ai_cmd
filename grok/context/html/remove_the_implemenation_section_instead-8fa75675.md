# StickerMaker

This project demonstrates an image processing script for your browser, designed to create stickers from images. The script utilizes TensorFlow.js to implement advanced image manipulation techniques, allowing users to transform ordinary images into fun and creative stickers.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine. Download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Project Initialization
1. Create a new directory for the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir stickermaker
   cd stickermaker
   ```
2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

### Dependencies
Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
```

## Pretrained Models for TensorFlow.js

For the StickerMaker project, we will leverage several pretrained models from TensorFlow.js to enhance our image processing capabilities:

### 1. **MobileNet**
MobileNet is a lightweight deep neural network ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. It can be used for image classification within our sticker creation process, helping to identify objects in the image for more targeted sticker effects.

### 2. **BodyPix**
BodyPix is a model for real-time person segmentation in the browser. It can be used to create stickers that automatically apply effects based on the human body detected in the image, such as adding fun masks or accessories.

### 3. **FaceLandmark68Net**
This model is designed for detecting 68 key points on a human face. It can be used to apply stickers precisely on facial features, such as eyes or mouth, for more personalized sticker creations.

### 4. **BlazeFace**
BlazeFace is a lightweight face detection model that can be used to quickly locate faces in images, which is crucial for applying face-related stickers efficiently.

## Usage
To run the script, execute:
```bash
node index.js
```

Ensure `inputImage.png` is in the same directory as `index.js`. The script will output a new image named `outputSticker.png` which is your transformed sticker.

## Notes
- This project is designed to work in a browser environment, allowing users to directly manipulate images in their web browsers.
- The functions `loadImage`, `createSticker`, and `saveSticker` are placeholders and need to be implemented with the specific logic for image processing and sticker creation.
- TensorFlow.js provides powerful tools for image manipulation, which can be leveraged to add effects like filters, borders, or even machine learning-based transformations to create unique stickers.
