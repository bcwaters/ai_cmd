# TensorFlow.js Overview

TensorFlow.js is an open-source library for machine learning in JavaScript, developed by Google. It allows developers to build and deploy machine learning models in the browser or on Node.js, making it accessible for web-based applications. Here's a more specific overview of TensorFlow.js:

## Key Features

- **Browser and Node.js Compatibility**: TensorFlow.js can run in any JavaScript environment, enabling machine learning directly in the browser or on the server.
- **Model Conversion**: It supports converting existing TensorFlow or Keras models to TensorFlow.js, facilitating the reuse of pre-trained models.
- **Layers API**: Similar to Keras, TensorFlow.js provides a high-level Layers API for building neural networks easily.
- **Visualization**: It integrates with TensorBoard for model visualization and debugging.
- **Performance**: TensorFlow.js is optimized for performance, with support for WebGL and WebAssembly for faster computation.

## Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use TensorFlow.js to create a linear regression model in the browser:

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Define the model
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));

// Compile the model
model.compile({optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError'});

// Dummy data
const xs = tf.tensor1d([-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);
const ys = tf.tensor1d([-3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7]);

// Train the model
async function train() {
  await model.fit(xs, ys, {epochs: 100});
}

// Make a prediction
async function predict(input) {
  const prediction = model.predict(tf.tensor2d([input], [1, 1]));
  console.log(`Prediction for ${input}: ${prediction.dataSync()[0]}`);
}

train().then(() => predict(10));
```

This example demonstrates creating a model, compiling it, training it with some dummy data, and making a prediction, all within a JavaScript environment.

## Further Learning
