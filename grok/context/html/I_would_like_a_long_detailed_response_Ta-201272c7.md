# 5th Grade Math Syllabus: Building Foundations for Linear Algebra and Deep Learning

This syllabus is designed to introduce 5th graders to foundational math concepts that will prepare them for advanced topics like linear algebra and deep learning. Each subject builds upon the previous one, creating a structured learning path.

## Subject 1: Introduction to Variables and Equations

**Purpose:** To understand the concept of variables and how to solve basic equations.
**Relation to Prior Lessons:** This is the foundational lesson, introducing students to the concept of unknowns in mathematics, which is essential for all subsequent subjects.

### Lesson Plan for Subject 1

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand the concept of variables and solve simple equations.

**Materials Needed:**
- Whiteboard and markers
- Worksheets with simple equations
- Manipulatives (e.g., algebra tiles)

**Introduction (10 minutes):**
- Start with a discussion about how we use symbols in everyday life (e.g., emojis, road signs).
- Introduce the concept of variables as symbols that represent unknown numbers.

**Direct Instruction (15 minutes):**
- Explain what an equation is and how it balances two sides.
- Demonstrate solving simple equations using examples like `x + 3 = 5`.
- Use algebra tiles to visually represent the equation and the process of solving it.

**Guided Practice (20 minutes):**
- Hand out worksheets with simple equations.
- Walk around the classroom to assist students as they solve the equations.
- Encourage students to use algebra tiles if needed.

**Independent Practice (15 minutes):**
- Students complete a set of more complex equations on their own.
- Provide immediate feedback and correction.

**Closure (10 minutes):**
- Review the key concepts learned.
- Ask students to share one equation they solved and how they did it.
- Assign homework: Solve five equations at home and bring them to the next class.
