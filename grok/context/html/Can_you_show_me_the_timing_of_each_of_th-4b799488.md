Here's a representation of the timing for each strumming pattern in tab format. Each pattern is shown with a duration of one measure in 4/4 time. The "D" represents a downstroke, and the "U" represents an upstroke. The placement of the strokes within the measure indicates their timing.

### DUD DUD

```
D|---D-------D---|
U|-----U---U-----|
```

### DDUUDU

These patterns can be adjusted for different tempos and feels, but this gives you a basic visual representation of where each stroke falls within a measure.
