Hello! How can I assist you with coding today?

Some follow-up questions you might consider:
- What specific programming language are you working with?
- Do you have a particular coding problem or project in mind?
- Are you looking for help with a certain aspect of coding, like algorithms, data structures, or debugging?

Feel free to ask anything related to coding, and I'll do my best to help in markdown format.
