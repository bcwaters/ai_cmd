# Sobel Edge Detection and Image Segmentation with TinyGrad

This project implements Sobel Edge Detection and basic image segmentation using the TinyGrad framework. Below is a detailed guide on the code, its functionality, and how to use it.

## Overview

The code provides a benchmark for processing images using Sobel Edge Detection and offers a foundation for image segmentation. It leverages TinyGrad for efficient tensor operations and edge detection.

## Key Features

- **Sobel Edge Detection**: Uses convolution to detect edges in images.
- **Image Segmentation**: Basic segmentation based on edge strength, suitable for further development into more advanced segmentation techniques.
- **Benchmarking**: Measures the performance of image processing on your hardware.
- **Command-line Interface**: Utilizes `argparse` for flexible usage.

## Code Structure

### Main Functions

1. **`process_image(image_path)`**:
   - Loads an image using TinyGrad.
   - Applies Sobel Edge Detection.
   - Returns the processed image.

2. **`benchmark(num_images, image_path)`**:
   - Measures the time taken to process a specified number of images.
   - Outputs performance metrics in images per second and per minute.

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py --num_images 100 --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your Python script and `/path/to/image.jpg` with the path to your input image.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TinyGrad
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

### Example Output

```
Processed 100 images in 10.50 seconds
Images per second: 9.52
Images per minute: 571.20
```

## Further Development

- **Advanced Segmentation**: Implement more sophisticated segmentation techniques like region growing or watershed segmentation.
- **Noise Reduction**: Add pre-processing steps to enhance edge detection.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Improve edge detection with adaptive thresholding methods.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib to visualize edge maps and segmentation results.

## Computational Complexity

The computational complexity for Sobel Edge Detection is O(M * N), where M and N are the dimensions of the image in pixels. This complexity applies to each image processed.

## Sobel Edge Detection

Sobel edge detection is a technique used to identify edges in an image. It works by applying two 3x3 convolution kernels to the image, one for detecting horizontal edges and another for vertical edges. The gradients in the x and y directions are calculated as follows:

- Horizontal gradient: G_x = [[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
- Vertical gradient: G_y = [[-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]

The magnitude of the gradient is then calculated using the formula:

\[ G = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2} \]

This gradient magnitude represents the strength of the edges in the image. A threshold can be applied to convert this gradient map into a binary edge map.

## Image Segmentation

Image segmentation involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify the representation of the image. In this project, basic segmentation is performed based on the edge strength detected by the Sobel operator. Pixels with edge strength above a certain threshold are considered part of an edge, and this information can be used to delineate regions in the image.

More advanced segmentation techniques could be implemented in the future, such as:

- **Region Growing**: Starting from seed points and growing regions based on similarity criteria.
- **Watershed Segmentation**: Treating the gradient magnitude as a topographic surface and flooding it from markers to segment the image.
