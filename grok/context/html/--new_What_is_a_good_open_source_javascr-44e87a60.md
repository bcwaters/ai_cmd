- **Lightweight and Fast**: Marked.js is known for its performance and small footprint, making it ideal for real-time previewing.
- **Extensible**: It supports plugins which can extend its functionality, such as syntax highlighting.
- **Wide Adoption**: It is used by many popular projects and websites, indicating its reliability and community support.

To get started with marked.js, you can install it via npm:
