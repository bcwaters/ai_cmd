To install the `vim-polyglot` plugin, you'll need to have a plugin manager like `vim-plug` installed in your Vim setup. Here's a step-by-step guide to install `vim-polyglot`:

1. **Ensure `vim-plug` is installed**: If you haven't installed `vim-plug` yet, you can do so by adding the following to your `.vimrc` file and then sourcing it or restarting Vim:

    ```vim
    " Install vim-plug if not already installed
    if empty(glob('~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim'))
      silent !curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs
        \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
      autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC
    endif
    ```

2. **Add `vim-polyglot` to your `.vimrc`**: Open your `.vimrc` file and add the following line within the `plug#begin` and `plug#end` section:

    ```vim
    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
    Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
    call plug#end()
    ```

    If you don't have a `plug#begin` and `plug#end` section yet, you can add it like this:

    ```vim
    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
    " Your other plugins go here
    Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
    call plug#end()
    ```

3. **Install the plugin**: After saving your `.vimrc` file, open Vim and run the following command to install the plugin:

    ```vim
    :PlugInstall
    ```

    This command will fetch and install `vim-polyglot` along with any other plugins you have listed in your `.vimrc`.

4. **Verify Installation**: Once the installation is complete, you can verify that `vim-polyglot` is installed by checking the plugin list with:

    ```vim
    :PlugStatus
    ```

    You should see `vim-polyglot` listed and marked as installed.

5. **Using `vim-polyglot`**: After installation, `vim-polyglot` will automatically enhance syntax highlighting for a wide range of programming languages. You don't need to do anything further; just open a file in Vim, and you should notice improved syntax highlighting.

That's it! You now have `vim-polyglot` installed and ready to use in your Vim environment.
