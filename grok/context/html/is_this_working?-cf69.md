Yes, the code provided for edge detection using Tinygrad should work as described. Here's a brief recap of the steps:

1. **Import Modules**: The necessary modules from Tinygrad, NumPy, and PIL are imported.
2. **Load and Preprocess Image**: An image is loaded, converted to grayscale, and transformed into a Tinygrad Tensor.
3. **Define Sobel Operators**: The Sobel operators for detecting edges in the x and y directions are defined as Tinygrad Tensors.
4. **Apply Sobel Operators**: The Sobel operators are applied to the image tensor to compute the gradient in both directions, and the gradient magnitude is calculated.
5. **Normalize and Save Result**: The gradient magnitude is normalized, converted back to a NumPy array, and saved as an image.

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:
- Ensure that the image path is correct.
- Verify that Tinygrad, NumPy, and PIL are properly installed and imported.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
