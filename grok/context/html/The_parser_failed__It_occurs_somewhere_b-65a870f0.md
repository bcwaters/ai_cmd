To bundle your scripts within an HTML file for offline use, there are more elegant methods than simply copying and pasting the script content into a `<script>` tag. Here are a few approaches:

### 1. **Using Base64 Encoding**

You can encode your JavaScript files in Base64 and embed them directly in your HTML. This method is useful for small scripts and ensures that the JavaScript is available without needing to access external files.

**Example:**

```html
<script>
  // Assuming 'script.js' is your JavaScript file
  const scriptContent = '/* Your JavaScript content here */';
  const base64Script = btoa(scriptContent);
</script>
<script src="data:text/javascript;base64,{{ base64Script }}"></script>
```

### 2. **Using Data URLs**

Data URLs allow you to embed your scripts directly in the HTML file. This approach is similar to Base64 encoding but more straightforward.

**Example:**

```html
<script>
  // Assuming 'script.js' is your JavaScript file
  const scriptContent = '/* Your JavaScript content here */';
</script>
<script src="data:text/javascript,{{ scriptContent }}"></script>
```

### 3. **Using a Build Tool**

For a more professional and scalable approach, you can use build tools like Webpack or Rollup to bundle your scripts and inline them into your HTML. These tools can optimize your code and manage dependencies efficiently.

**Example with Webpack:**

You can configure Webpack to inline your scripts using the `html-webpack-inline-source-plugin`.

**webpack.config.js:**

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const HtmlWebpackInlineSourcePlugin = require('html-webpack-inline-source-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
      inlineSource: '.(js|css)$' // inline all js and css
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackInlineSourcePlugin()
  ]
};
```

**src/index.html:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

After running Webpack, your JavaScript will be inlined into the HTML file.

### 4. **Using a Task Runner like Gulp**

Gulp can also be used to inline scripts into your HTML file.

**Example:**

```javascript
const gulp = require('gulp');
const inline = require('gulp-inline');

gulp.task('inline', function() {
  return gulp.src('src/index.html')
    .pipe(inline({
      base: 'src/',
      js: ['script.js']
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/'));
});
```

Possible causes of the parsing error:
- **Text Encoding Issues**: The response might contain special characters or non-ASCII text that are not being properly encoded or decoded.
- **Markdown Syntax Errors**: Incorrect use of markdown syntax, such as mismatched or improperly formatted code blocks, could cause parsing issues.
- **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Inconsistent line breaks or extra whitespace might interfere with the parser's ability to correctly interpret the markdown.
- **Character Escaping**: Failure to properly escape certain characters (like backslashes or ampersands) can lead to parsing errors.
