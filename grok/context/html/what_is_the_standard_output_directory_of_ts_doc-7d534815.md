The standard output directory for TypeDoc, which is a popular tool for generating documentation from TSDoc comments, is typically named `docs` or `out`. However, this can be customized using the `--out` or `--output` command-line option.

Here is an example of how to specify a custom output directory with TypeDoc:

```bash
typedoc --out custom-docs-path src/
```

This command tells TypeDoc to generate documentation for the `src/` directory and place the output in the `custom-docs-path` directory.
