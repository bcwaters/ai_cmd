# Foundational Math Concepts

## Subject 2: Introduction to Fractions

**Purpose:** To introduce students to the concept of fractions, their representation, and basic operations with them.

**Relation to Prior Lessons:** Building on the understanding of numbers and basic arithmetic, fractions introduce students to the concept of parts of a whole, which is crucial for more advanced mathematical concepts.

### Detailed Lesson Plan:

#### Introduction to Fractions

A fraction represents a part of a whole or a part of a set. It is written as two numbers separated by a horizontal line, with the number above the line being the numerator and the number below the line being the denominator.

**Example:** The fraction \(\frac{3}{4}\) represents three parts of a whole that is divided into four equal parts.

#### Representing Fractions

Fractions can be represented visually using diagrams, such as pie charts or bar models, to help students understand the concept better.

**Example:** A pie chart divided into four equal parts with three parts shaded represents the fraction \(\frac{3}{4}\).

```latex
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \pie{4/3}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

#### Basic Operations with Fractions

Students will learn how to perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with fractions.

**Example: Adding Fractions**

To add fractions with the same denominator, simply add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

```latex
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} &= \frac{1 + 2}{4} \\\\ 
&= \frac{3}{4}
\end{align*}
```

**Example: Multiplying Fractions**

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

```latex
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} &= \frac{1 \times 3}{2 \times 4} \\\\ 
&= \frac{3}{8}
\end{align*}
```

#### Practice Problems

1. Add the fractions \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\).

```latex
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} &= \frac{1 + 1}{3} \\\\ 
&= \frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}
```

2. Multiply the fractions \(\frac{2}{5}\) and \(\frac{3}{4}\).

```latex
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{4} &= \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 4} \\\\ 
&= \frac{6}{20} \\\\ 
&= \frac{3}{10}
\end{align*}
```

These exercises help students become comfortable with the concept of fractions and their operations, setting the stage for more advanced topics in mathematics.
