When dealing with an image that has transparency, such as a large circle with a transparent outside and inside, flood fill can still be used, but you need to consider a few things:

1. **Transparency Handling**: The effectiveness of flood fill on an image with transparency depends on how the transparency is treated by the image processing library. In PIL (Python Imaging Library), transparency is typically stored in the alpha channel.

2. **Conversion to Grayscale**: The script provided earlier converts the image to grayscale, which discards the alpha channel. If you want to fill based on transparency, you'll need to work with the alpha channel directly.

3. **Flood Fill Starting Point**: Since the image has a transparent outside and inside, choosing the right starting point for flood fill is crucial. You'll need to start from a point within the circle but outside the inner transparent area.

Here's an adjusted version of the script to handle transparency:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

def flood_fill_transparent(image_path, output_path):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGBA')  # Keep the alpha channel
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)

    # Get the image dimensions
    width, height = image.size

    # Start flood fill from a point within the circle but outside the inner transparent area
    # Assuming the circle's center is at (width/2, height/2) and radius is half the smaller dimension
    radius = min(width, height) // 2
    start_x, start_y = width // 2, height // 2 - radius // 2

    # Flood fill using the alpha channel
    draw.floodfill((start_x, start_y), (255, 255, 255, 255), thresh=50)

    # Save the result
    image.save(output_path)

# Example usage
flood_fill_transparent('input_image.png', 'output_filled_image.png')
```

This script does the following:

1. Opens the image and keeps it in RGBA mode to preserve the alpha channel.
2. Calculates a starting point for flood fill, assuming the circle's center and a point just inside the outer edge.
3. Performs flood fill on the alpha channel to fill the interior of the circle.
4. Saves the result.

**Key Considerations:**

- The success of this method depends on accurately choosing the starting point for flood fill. You might need to adjust the `start_x` and `start_y` based on your image's specifics.
- The `thresh` parameter helps to fill regions with similar transparency levels.
- If the inner transparent area is very close to the outer edge, you might need to manually select a starting point.
