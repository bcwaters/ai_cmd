# Testing Strategy

This directory contains tests for the Grok application. The tests are organized to support both unit testing and integration testing approaches.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. They typically mock all dependencies to ensure that only the specific unit of code is being tested.

**Characteristics:**
- Fast execution
- Tests a single unit of functionality
- Dependencies are mocked
- Helps identify where bugs occur
- Easier to write and maintain

**Example:** Testing that the `parseCommandLineArgs` function correctly extracts arguments from process.argv.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. They use real implementations of some or all dependencies.

**Characteristics:**
- Tests interactions between components
- Some or all dependencies use real implementations
- More realistic testing scenarios
- Can catch issues that unit tests miss
- Usually slower than unit tests

**Example:** Testing that `getConversationContext` correctly interacts with the file system and the `cleanString` utility.

## Recommended Directory Structure

For a cleaner organization, consider the following directory structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/                  # Unit tests with heavy mocking
│   ├── prompt_profiles/   # Tests for prompt profiles
│   ├── utils/             # Tests for utility functions
│   └── grok/              # Tests for core functionality
├── integration/           # Integration tests with real dependencies
│   ├── api/               # Tests for API interactions
│   ├── filesystem/        # Tests for file system operations
│   └── end-to-end/        # Full workflow tests
├── mocks/                 # Shared mock implementations
├── fixtures/              # Test data files
└── helpers/               # Test utility functions
```

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Name test files with `.test.js` suffix for unit tests and `.integration.js` for integration tests.

2. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.

3. **Mock Management**: Create reusable mocks in a dedicated directory to avoid duplication.

4. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, but focus on critical paths first.

5. **Test Readability**: Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to make tests clear and maintainable.

## Running Tests

- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run unit tests only: `npm run test:unit`
- Run integration tests only: `npm run test:integration`

## Future Improvements

- Add snapshot testing for complex output structures
- Implement E2E tests for critical user workflows
- Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
- Add performance tests for resource-intensive operations
