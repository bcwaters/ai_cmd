      "revised_prompt": "A 16-panel sprite sheet in NES style, featuring a character with short red hair wearing a dinosaur hat. Each panel is equally spaced and displays the character in four different walking directions: up, right, left, and down, with four panels for each direction. The background is transparent, and the entire sprite sheet is pixelated to match the retro NES aesthetic. The character's attire and the dinosaur hat are detailed within the pixel art style, with slight color variations to highlight the character against a clear background. No additional elements or text are included to maintain focus on the character's movements and design."
